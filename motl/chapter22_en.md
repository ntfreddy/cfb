Chapter 22—The Organizing Theme
“Seventh-day Adventism is one of the most subtly differentiated, systematically developed and
institutionallysuccessful of all alternatives to the American way of life. . . . The central figure in
Adventism has remained largely out of public view. Ellen White . . . her life and thought shaped the
characteristic features of Adventism. To understand how and why Adventism has impinged on the
public consciousness, a detailed analysis of Adventist theology and Ellen White‟s writings is
necessary.” cmlxxxvii1
In the preceding chapters we have observed that Ellen White and the history of the Adventist
movement are as interconnected as the warp and woof of a beautiful rug. The same can be said
about the close relationship between Ellen White and the Adventist mind as expressed in its
distinctive theological contribution, its educational and health principles, its sense of social
responsibilities, and its missiology. cmlxxxviii2 Without Ellen White, the Adventist mind in all these areas,
as historically understood, would be as porous as a window screen. cmlxxxix3
The uniqueness of Ellen White‘s contribution lies not in total originality of thought but in her
synthesis of divinely revealed insights and the results of her own reading and observation. While
selecting specific expressions from her contemporaries that helped her to depict more fully the broad
principles of truth that were revealed to her, she avoided notions from those same authors that were
not consonant with those principles.
The Great Controversy Theme
All significant theologies have an organizing principle. cmxc4 Many scholars have identified Ellen
White‘s unifying principle as the Great Controversy Theme. This provided a coherent framework for
her theological thought as well as for her principles in education, health, missiology, social issues, and environmental topics. cmxci5 Not that she single-handedly devised these interacting thought patterns, but she was the conceptual nurturer, urging study, noting errors, always exhorting freshness, not novelty. Along with nurturing, her own writings helped to form a core of Biblical understanding that provided integrity to the development of Adventist thought. cmxcii6 George Knight, church historian, suggests that by focusing on the Great Controversy Theme ―we can tell when we are on center or chasing stray geese near the edges of what is really important.‖ In pointing to what Ellen White calls the ―grand central theme‖ of the Bible, Knight wrote that ―in such passages we find our marching orders for the reading of both the Bible and the writings of Ellen White. . . . All our reading takes place within that context, and those issues closest to the grand central theme are obviously of more importance than those near its edges.‖ cmxciii7 The conceptual key. Ellen White defined the Great Controversy Theme as the conceptual ―key‖ to understanding humanity‘s greatest questions: How did life begin? Why good and evil, and how does one know the difference? What happens after death? Why suffering and death? The Great Controversy Theme provides the background for the development of
257 evil—the story of Lucifer‘s (Satan‘s) rebellion against the government of God. The thrust of Satan‘s argument is that God cannot be trusted, that His law is severe and unfair, and thus the Lawgiver is unfair, severe, and arbitrary. cmxciv8 Satan‘s initial success in winning the allegiance of one-third of the angels in heaven was followed by his deceiving Adam and Eve (Rev. 12:4, 7-9; Gen. 3:1-16). By so doing, this earth has experienced all the bitter fruit of distrusting God and spurning His will. God‘s response has been, not to destroy Satan, but to expose him. God‘s long-term interest is to demonstrate how wrong Satan has been to charge Him with being supremely selfish, arbitrary, and unfair. Primarily through the life and death of Jesus, and through His designated people on earth, God has been revealing and demonstrating His side of the story. cmxcv9 The controversy ends on this earth only after God‘s people give glory to Him (Rev. 14:7) in such a way that all earthly inhabitants can make an intelligent decision as to whether God‘s program is something they should choose for themselves. All must decide whether they would be eternally comfortable in keeping ―the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus‖ (Rev. 14:12). After ushering in the return of Jesus, the controversy is reviewed during the millennium and finally settled when the chorus echoes from world to world, ―Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, for His judgments are true and just.‘ . . . ‗Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns, Let us rejoice and exult and give Him the glory‘‖ (Rev. 19:1-7). The rebellion is over. The Purpose of God’s Strategy in the Great Controversy God‘s purpose in the Controversy is twofold: (1) To demonstrate before all the universe ―the nature of rebellion‖ and, in so doing, ―vindicate . . . [His] character,‖ cmxcvi10 and (2) to restore in men and women ―the image of God.‖ More than forgiveness, the goal of the gospel is restoration. cmxcvii11 The new earth will be populated with those who have let God fulfill His plan for restoring His image in them. Thus, the goal of redemption is not forgiveness but restoration; the purpose of the gospel is to restore all that was harmed by sin, to bring men and women back to their original state, step by step. cmxcviii12 Only by redeeming overcomers (Rev. 3:5, 12, 21) will God be able to ―place things on an eternal basis of security.‖ cmxcix13 The vindication of God‘s fairness and trustworthiness, coupled with the concept of restoration as being the purpose of the gospel brought a Biblical freshness to Ellen White‘s theological system and provided coherence to all other aspects of her teachings. Unfolding the Theme
How does the Great Controversy Theme inform and determine those principles of theology, education, health, and all the other topics that Ellen White has unified into a coherent, interconnected, distinctively Adventist way of life? What are those theological principles that undergird and permeate all these various aspects of Adventist thought? Each of the following foundation principles not only unfolds the Theme but also exposes some error in contemporary Christian thought: God is not the kind of person that Satan has made Him out to be. God is not severe, unforgiving, harsh, arbitrary, or unfair. m14 Although God revealed Himself in His law and other revelations through His prophets, Jesus is God‘s clearest revelation. mi15 What we need to know about God can be understood by observing the actions of Jesus and listening to His counsel while on earth. In revealing the truth about God, Jesus revealed God‘s image. mii16 In revealing the truth about human beings, Jesus manifested humanity‘s lost image,
258 the image He has promised to restore in all who trust Him and obey His will. miii17 (a) Jesus proved that God was not unfair—that is, He did not make laws that created beings cannot keep. miv18 (b) Jesus proved that God was not selfish by demanding submission and sacrifice from His created intelligences without manifesting the same willingness to sacrifice for others. His own life and death, an eternal gift to humanity, revealed God‘s unselfishness toward His created beings. mv19 (c) Jesus proved that God was not ―severe, exacting, and harsh,‖ by revealing God‘s tact, thoughtfulness, self-denial, forbearance, and love under rejection. mvi20 Because God is fair, loving, and respectful of His created intelligences, He does not coerce, force, intimidate, or deceive them in order to obtain their loyalty, submission, or compliance. mvii21 (a) He does not use peer pressure, or compel a person to make a decision against his or her will, or attempt to bypass reason—all of which are techniques employed by the forces of evil. mviii22 (b) He appeals to reason and waits for each person to decide on the basis of the weight of evidence and the constraint of love. mix23 (c) Thus, His people are to be known for their defense of liberty for others and the absence of oppressive methods among themselves. mx24 Because God is willing to wait until all the evidence is in regarding Satan‘s charges, and because He will not force compliance, the principle of conditionality permeates His relationship with His created intelligences—He waits for people to respond. mxi25 (a) The process of salvation by faith requires certain human conditions more than mere mental assent and appreciation for what Christ has done. Saved people are transformed rebels (the degree of change subject to the time and opportunities available), and transformation involves human decisions at every step. mxii26 (b) The timing of the Second Advent depends, in part, on certain human conditions. The Advent is delayed, depending on the preparedness of God‘s people to receive the latter rain and thus be equipped to help implement the ―loud cry‖ that brings the world to decision. mxiii27 (c) The incarnation of Jesus Christ involved a conditionality that beggars the human imagination—the possibility that Jesus might fail. mxiv28 (d) Character development determines destiny—the human response to God‘s gifts of destiny—pardon and power. mxv29
Human beings were created to be God‘s counterparts, ―in His own image.‖ They were created to communicate with God and with freedom to choose. Thus, they are responsible (able-to-respond) beings; human beings can be irresponsible, but never unresponsible—they were, and are, free moral agents. mxvi30 (a) Since men and women are responsible beings, it is evident that they are not totally depraved; their destiny is not determined by a sovereign God who ―elects‖ some to be saved and others to be lost. mxvii31 (b) Because human beings are responsible beings, God must communicate with them in human terms, in thought patterns that humans can understand. For this reason, the principle of the incarnation explains why Jesus ―took humanity with all its liabilities‖ in order that His followers would know that He identified with them in every way. mxviii32 (c) The principle of the incarnation explains why God used the thought patterns and vocabulary of human beings when He revealed Himself in the Bible. mxix33 Human beings were created as an indivisible whole wherein such components
259 as the physical body, mind, soul, spirit, emotions, and the will interact, influencing each of the other components. Components are interdependent and all are needed for human beings to survive in a healthy state. mxx34 (a) Thus, people do not possess immortal souls that live in physical bodies for a short space of time. When they physically die, they do not continue to live somewhere in a spiritual, disembodied state. They ―sleep‖ (in Biblical terms) awaiting the call of the Life Giver. mxxi35 (b) Because human beings are not composed of three units (body, spirit, soul) separate from one another, the well being of the physical body directly affects the health of the mind (including the emotions and spiritual values), and vice versa. Each person‘s health depends on the optimal interacting of all that contributes to a healthy body and to a healthy mind. mxxii36 Because God is love He yearns for a loving response from human beings. He has promised eternal life to those who freely appreciate His love and who choose to obey His loving will for them. mxxiii37 (a) Thus, eternal life is promised to those who cheerfully forsake their sins and gladly cooperate with His Spirit in reconstructing their habit patterns so that they will spontaneously love others—the ultimate will of their loving Lord. mxxiv38 (b) Thus, God will not play word games and ―save‖ those who mentally say the right words but whose lives do not reflect, in some maturing fashion, the profession of their lips. mxxv39 (c) Therefore, God has permitted the law of cause and effect to play out so that created intelligences throughout the universe, as well as human beings, can see the results of both obedience and disobedience to God‘s expressed will. mxxvi40 (d) The redeemed will be composed of those who have cooperated with God in developing a habitual attitude of loving trust and cheerful obedience to His will; they have demonstrated that they can be trusted with eternal life, never again to put the security of the universe in jeopardy. mxxvii41
One Thread Unravels the Fabric As one studies the history of the Christian church it is interesting to note the results of unraveling even one thread (one doctrine) of the coherent fabric of truth. The cohesiveness and inner coherence of truth is one mark of its authenticity. When a person takes one doctrine—for instance, the nature of man—and imposes on it an unscriptural definition such as the immortal soul notion, other doctrines are affected in some way. When one removes conditionality from the plan of salvation, human responsibility is diminished and the sovereignty of God is exaggerated or misunderstood. The unifying and synoptic range of Ellen White‘s contribution to the development of the Adventist movement is the result of her lucid understanding of the principles inherent in the Great Controversy Theme. Ellen White‘s theological concepts were not ―divinely‖ transmitted through her as water passes through a pipe. Nor was she a systematic theologian. She was primarily a communicator, guided by heavenly counsel. Her mission was to comfort where people needed encouragement and to correct those errors that either misrepresent God or incorrectly define how men and women are finally saved. mxxviii42 Her understanding of theology, though grounded in vision experiences, grew through the years as she listened to her Adventist colleagues cross-pollinate each other with their Biblical studies. mxxix43 The Key That Unlocked Mysteries Ellen White‘s theological plumb line, as governed by the Great Controversy Theme and affirmed by revelation, remained the same, even as her insights
260 deepened. Her theological discernment provided a unifying center that helped church members to share with others, in a lucid and convincing manner, the coherent message. Her written understanding of the sanctuary doctrine, for example, became the microcosm of the plan of salvation. This teaching not only was the ―key‖ that unlocked the mystery of the 1844 disappointment, ―it opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and harmonious, showing that God‘s hand had directed the great Advent Movement, and revealing present duty as it brought to light the position and work of His people. . . . Light from the sanctuary illumined the past, the present, and the future.‖ mxxx44 From the earliest days of her prophetic ministry, Ellen White saw in the three angels‘ messages (Rev. 14:1-12) ―the perfect chain of truth.‖ Flowing from within this ―chain‖ was the sanctuary doctrine. These Biblical messages ―were represented to [her] as an anchor to hold the body.‖ mxxxi45 The “Theme” Transcends Modern Errors The Great Controversy Theme transcends the tensions, paradoxes, and antinomies of conventional philosophy and theology. Tensions between all groups have roots that go back to the earliest ―falling away‖ predicted by the apostle Paul. mxxxii46 Each particular church with its distinctive theology is emphasizing some aspect of truth that it holds precious. Yet, its leaders and members see their opponents as heretics, and the best they will settle for is a cease-fire, not a truce. Contending church groups are like two circles of partial truth, neither circle knowing how to bring the two together into a coherent, elliptical whole. The Ellipse of Truth The Great Controversy Theme, however, changes those opposing circles into an ellipse. By using the principle of the ellipse, mxxxiii47 each circle finds its treasured truths (for which its adherents have been willing to die) safely preserved, even greatly enhanced. In the ellipse, truth is united in such a way that its fundamental components are not seen as antithetical, but as correlates. mxxxiv48
Truth is not the sum of paradoxes. Truth is the union of components in such a way that when one component is not connected to the other, something serious happens to even that portion of truth each group holds precious. For example, H2O is another way of saying ―water.‖ Hydrogen and oxygen by themselves are very important, but without their proper union, water does not exist. The question of whether hydrogen or oxygen is more important becomes meaningless when one needs water to drink. The truth about water is that water does not exist unless both hydrogen and oxygen are in proper relationship to each other. The same is true with components in the ellipse of truth. mxxxv49 Another way to illustrate the usefulness of the ellipse analogy is to observe how Ellen White speaks of law and gospel, not as antithetical but as correlates. It thus follows that the law does not forbid what the gospel permits, and the gospel does not permit what the law forbids. Further, to emphasize the law in the Christian‘s experience is not a journey into legalism. Ellen White highlighted how Jesus rejected the legalism of the Pharisees which led to bondage and pride while emphasizing that the law will guide the Christian ―till heaven and earth pass away.‖ mxxxvi50 The Christian obeys God‘s law, not to impress Him but to honor Him, not in fearful compliance but in grateful submission and joyful loyalty. In philosophy and theology, the two circles, representing the usual ―two sides‖ of almost every argument, are generally known as ―objectivism‖ and ―subjectivism.‖ Towering theological and philosophical thinkers can be catalogued in one or the other of the two circles. The various churches within Christianity can also be catalogued as being either ―objectivist‖ or ―subjectivist.‖ The history of theology is
261 the story of which circle is predominant at the moment—and the recurring oscillation, the persistent pendulum swing between the two foci of the ellipse, is as predictable as the rising of the sun. mxxxvii51 Conservatives and Liberals In typical religious language, conservatives form the ―objectivist‖ circle and liberals are in the ―subjectivist‖ circle, although these labels are far from satisfactory. Each circle is emphasizing something correct, timely, and needed. Even as water is not formed until the circles of hydrogen and oxygen are reformed as an ellipse, so the partial truths represented by conservatives and liberals do not set forth the full picture of truth until they are both cast within the ellipse of truth. Key words for conservatives (for which they will fight to the death) are: transcendence, authority, orthodoxy, rootage, law, structure, security, and grace—all good words to hold on to. But the historic weakness of conservatives is often a misunderstanding of the character of the transcendent God. They often emphasize authority at the expense of human responsibility and freedom. Because of these misunderstandings, faith becomes mainly a mental assent to doctrine. Some form of ―only believe‖ is stressed. The result too often is human passivity in the salvation process. Key words for liberals (for which they also will fight to the death) are: immanence, freedom, responsibility, reason, flexibility, meaning, relevance, and personal faith—also good words to hold on to. The historic weakness of liberalism is rooted in its subjectivity. Pietists, mystics, rationalists, charismatics (and whoever else puts human autonomy ―in front‖ of divinely revealed truths) base their security either on reason, feeling, intuition, or historical research. Absolutes are rarely appealed to. ―It must make sense to me‖ is often heard—a wish not to be overlooked. In modern times, both conservatives and liberals cross lines when they no longer ask, ―Is it true?‖ but rather, ―Does it work?‖ Pragmatic experientialism puts the question, ―What is there in it for me?‖ rather than the more Biblical ―What am I going to do about it?‖
Ellen White puts these questions into proper perspective as she appeals to both the traditional conservatives and liberals to see the answers within the Great Controversy Theme. She understood well this historic standoff between these two circles and how both conservatives and liberals alike will fail to see the wholepicture without the ellipse of truth that transcends the weakness of both conservatives and liberals. She wrote: ―The progress of reform depends upon a clear recognition of
fundamental truth. While, on the one hand, danger lurks in a narrow philosophy and a hard, cold orthodoxy, on the other hand there is great danger in a careless liberalism. The foundation of all enduring reform is the law of God. We are to present in clear, distinct lines the need of obeying this law.‖ mxxxviii52 ―Hard, cold orthodoxy‖ and ―careless liberalism‖ are the end results of placing truth in two circles rather than letting truth be truth in its elliptical form. Ellen White transcends these two circles by uniting authority and responsibility, doctrinal security and heart assurance, so that the Seventh-day Adventist Church does not need to fall back into the theological arguments that divide all other churches. Most every Biblical argument, traditionally, presents the observer with an either/or choice. The ellipse of truth shows how important positions are to be joined by the indispensable and, either spoken or implied. Twin Truths are Joined The following examples show where Ellen White has transcended the either/or arguments in crucial theological areas wherein Christians have been divided for centuries. In these examples, note the ellipse of truth joining twin components as securely as hydrogen bonds with oxygen to make water:
262 1. The relationship between Christ‟s work on the cross and the work of the Holy Spirit: ―The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no avail. . . . It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought out by the world‘s Redeemer.‖ mxxxix53 2. The relationship between the law and the gospel: ―No man can rightly present the law of God without the gospel, or the gospel without the law. The law is the gospel embodied, and the gospel is the law unfolded. The law is the root, the gospel is the fragrant blossom and fruit which it bears.‖ mxl54 3. The relationship between Christ as Redeemer and as Ruler: ―Let this point be fully settled in every mind: If we accept Christ as a Redeemer, we must accept Him as a Ruler. We cannot have the assurance and perfect confiding trust in Christ as our Saviour until we acknowledge Him as our King and are obedient to His commandments. Thus we evidence our allegiance to God. We have the genuine ring in our faith, for it is a working faith. It works by love.‖ mxli55 4. The relationship between objective authority and subjective responsibility in the faith experience: ―Faith in Christ as the world‘s Redeemer calls for an acknowledgment of the enlightened intellect, controlled by a heart that can discern and appreciate the heavenly treasure. This faith is inseparable from repentance and transformation of character. To have faith means to find and accept the gospel treasure, with all the obligations which it imposes.‖ mxlii56 5. The relationship between God‟s work and man‟s work in the salvation process: ―God works and cooperates with the gifts He has imparted to man, and man, by being a partaker of the divine nature and doing the work of Christ, may be an overcomer and win eternal life. The Lord does not propose to do the work He has given man powers to do. Man‘s part must be done. He must be a laborer together with God, yoking up with Christ. . . . God is the all-controlling power. He bestows the gifts; man receives them and acts with the power of the grace of Christ as a living agent. . . . Divine power and the human agency combined will be a complete success, for Christ‘s righteousness accomplishes everything.‖ mxliii57 6. The relationship between imputed and imparted righteousness: ―Our only ground of hope is in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought out by His Spirit working in and through us.‖ mxliv58
7. The relationship between forgiveness of sin and a transformed life in defining genuine Christianity: ―The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of sin; it means taking away our sins, and filling the vacuum with the graces of the Holy Spirit. It means divine illumination, rejoicing in God. It means a heart emptied of self, and blessed with the abiding presence of Christ. When Christ
reigns in the soul, there is purity, freedom from sin. The glory, the fullness, the completeness of the gospel plan is fulfilled in the life. The acceptance of the Saviour brings a glow of perfect peace, perfect love, perfect assurance. The beauty and fragrance of the character of Christ revealed in the life testifies that God has indeed sent His Son into the world to be its Saviour.‖ mxlv59 8. The relationship between the prayer for pardon and the prayer for divine help to resist sin: To show how simple theology, rightly put, can be understood by the general public, note Ellen White‘s report of a sermon she preached in Basel, Switzerland: ―All listened with the deepest interest, and at the close of the discourse an invitation was given for all who desired to be Christians, and all who felt that they had not a living connection with God, to come forward, and we would unite our prayers with theirs for the pardon of sin, and for grace to resist temptation.‖ mxlvi60 9. The relationship between Christ‟s role as Sacrifice/Saviour and as High Priest/Mediator: ―Satan invents unnumbered
263 schemes to occupy our minds, that they may not dwell upon the very work with which we ought to be best acquainted. The archdeceiver hates the great truths that bring to view an atoning sacrifice and an all-powerful mediator. He knows that with him everything depends on his diverting minds from Jesus and His truth.‖ mxlvii61 10. The relationship between the new birth and obedience to God‟s law: ―In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgression and rebellion to obedience and loyalty.‖ mxlviii62 11. The relationship between repentance and reformation: ―No repentance is genuine that does not work reformation. The righteousness of Christ is not a cloak to cover unconfessed and unforsaken sin; it is a principle of life that transforms the character and controls the conduct. Holiness is wholeness for God; it is the entire surrender of heart and life to the indwelling of the principles of heaven.‖ mxlix63 12. The relationship between the work of Christ without and the work of the Spirit within: ―I call upon every one who claims to be a son of God, never to forget this great truth, that we need the Spirit of God within us in order to reach heaven, and the work of Christ without us in order to give us a title to the immortal inheritance.‖ ml64 13. The relationship between faith and works: “Abraham‟s faith was made manifest by his works. . . . There are many who fail to understand the relation of faith and works. They say, ‗Only believe in Christ and you are safe. You have nothing to do with keeping the law.‘ But genuine faith will be manifest in obedience.‖ mli65 14. The relationship between the old and new covenants: ―As the Bible presents two laws, one changeless and eternal, the other provisional and temporary, so there are two covenants. The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden. . . . To all men this covenant offered pardon, and the assisting grace of God for future obedience through faith in Christ. . . . The law of God was the basis of this covenant, which was simply an arrangement for bringing men again into harmony with the divine will. . . . Another compact—called in Scripture the ‗old‘ covenant—was formed between God and Israel at Sinai. . . . But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of redemption, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? . . . Living in the midst of idolatry and corruption, they had no true conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sinfulness of their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to render obedience to God‘s law, and their need of a Saviour. All this they must be taught. . . . The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone, is written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart.‖ mlii66 15. The relationship between believing in Christ and abiding in Him: ―It is not enough that the sinner believe in Christ for the pardon of sin; he must, by faith and obedience, abide in Him.‖ mliii67
16. The relationship between Christ‟s free gift of remission of sins and His free gift of His attributes in the development of the Christian‟s character: ―His life stands for the life of men. Thus they have remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God. More than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes of God. He builds up the human character after the similitude of the divine
character, a goodly fabric of spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the very righteousness of the law is fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God can ‗be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus‘ (Rom. 3:26).‖ mliv68 ―The intercession of Christ in man‘s behalf in the sanctuary above is as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. By His death He began that work which after His resurrection He ascended to complete in heaven.‖ mlv69
Chapter 23—Clarification of Major Doctrines “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Tim. 3:16). Because of the Great Controversy Theme as expressed in the ellipse principle, Ellen White was able to transcend the objectivists (undue emphasis on doctrinal correctness) and the subjectivists (undue emphasis on feeling or human autonomy) of her time. This ability was very evident in the 1888 Minneapolis doctrinal crisis. Note how she transcended the tensions in contemporary theologies: ―While one class pervert the doctrine of justification by faith and neglect to comply with the conditions laid down in the Word of God—‗If ye love Me, keep My commandments‘—there is fully as great an error on the part of those who claim to believe and obey the commandments of God but who place themselves in opposition to the precious rays of light—new to them—reflected from the cross of Calvary. The first class do not see the wondrous things in the law of God for all who are doers of His Word. The others cavil over trivialities and neglect the weightier matters, mercy and the love of God. ―Many have lost very much in that they have not opened the eyes of their understanding to discern the wondrous things in the law of God. On the other hand, religionists generally have divorced the law and the gospel, while we have, on the other hand, almost done the same from another standpoint. We have not held up before the people the righteousness of Christ and the full significance of His great plan of redemption. We have left out Christ and His matchless love, brought in theories and reasonings, and preached argumentative discourses.‖ mlvi1 Limited ideas of the character and purposes of God lead to limited ideas of the atonement. Monumental arguments have arisen throughout Christian history because the disputants did not understand the truths involved in the Great Controversy. mlvii2 Larger View of the Plan of Salvation Ellen White was led to see the results of ―limited views of the atonement.‖ mlviii3 Some of these results included: (1) A limited sense of what Christ suffered on Calvary, linking His agony to physical pain only. mlix4 (2) A limited sense of how the Father was involved in the agony of Calvary, not comprehending that God‘s wrath expressed in His withdrawal of His immediate presence was the ultimate ―price of redemption.‖ mlx5 (3) A limited sense of how Christ‘s life and death together ―were earning the right‖ for Jesus to become humanity‘s High Priest. mlxi6 (4) A limited sense of how far-reaching Christ‘s atonement was in that it
269 (5) embraced everyone who has ever lived, this limited sense caused by the presupposition that God‘s sovereignty has chosen both the special ―elect‖ and those predestined to burn in an eternal hell-fire. mlxii7 (6) A limited sense of the ―cost‖ of what God ―gave‖ (John 3:16) in the death of Jesus by not recognizing that Jesus did not resume all of His former prerogatives, that He indeed ―gave‖ Himself to the human race, to forever identify as a human with the human race—He was forever limited to time and space. mlxiii8
(7) A limited sense of what Christ ―satisfied‖ on Calvary in not recognizing that He died to give sinners a ―second probation . . . that they might return to their loyalty and keep God‘s commandments,‖ not that He died so that obedience to God‘s law was unnecessary. mlxiv9 (8) A limited sense of the ―atonement‖ by confining the benefits to justification only, not grasping that the atonement was a ―divine remedy for the cure of transgression and the restoration of spiritual health,‖ not sensing that it provided the means ―by which the righteousness of Christ may be not only upon us but in our hearts and characters.‖ mlxv10 (9) A limited sense of the depth in Jesus‘ cry, ―My God, my God, why? . . .‖ whenever a person believes in the immortal soul error, not realizing that His hour of death was that which all sinners will experience in their ―second‖ death after the judgment. Nobody on this planet except Christ has really died, those who have ―passed on‖ are only sleeping, awaiting the Life Giver‘s call; Jesus felt the final agony of sinners who realize what they have rejected. mlxvi11 Further, Jesus experienced the unspeakable ―wages of sin‖ (Rom. 6:23), thus proving that Satan was wrong when he said, ―You will not surely die‖ (Gen. 3:4). (10) A limited sense of sin in that most Christians have no idea of the universal implication of sin on this earth and how it affects the well-being of the universe. mlxvii12 (11) A limited sense of how God plans, because of the atonement, to ―place things on an eternal basis of security,‖ a plan that involves an executive review including angels prior to the Second Advent of all people who have ever lived, and then a peer review conducted by the redeemed between the two resurrections (John 5:29). mlxviii13 Sickness, Suffering, and Death Because of Ellen White‘s understanding of the Great Controversy Theme, she could clearly teach why suffering existed, who caused it, and when it would end. Amidst a mountain of speculative books written since the dawn of history on the problem of suffering, she lucidly explained that ―sickness, suffering, and death are [the] work of an antagonistic power. Satan is the destroyer; God is the restorer.‖ mlxix14 Throughout Christian history the notion has prevailed that God punishes sinners and that a suffering sinner must accept his or her plight as the will of God. An incorrect picture of God‘s character produces this kind of thinking. Because of Ellen White‘s understanding of the Great Controversy as it unfolds in the Biblical story, she was able to transcend the prevailing view: ―It is true that all suffering results from the transgression of God‘s law, but this truth had become perverted. Satan, the author of sin and all its results, had led men to look upon disease and death as proceeding from God—as punishment arbitrarily inflicted on account of sin. . . . The history of Job had shown that suffering is inflicted by Satan, and is overruled by God for purposes of mercy. But Israel did not understand the lesson. The same error for which God had reproved the friends of Job was repeated by the Jews in their rejection of Christ.‖ mlxx15 Ellen White did not lay the blame for all suffering on Satan‘s direct intervention. She recognized that whenever men and women accept Satan‘s philosophy of self-indulgence they open the door to sad consequences. Jesus ―taught that they had
270 brought disease upon themselves by transgressing the laws of God, and that health could be preserved only by obedience.‖ mlxxi16
Yet, she saw even more in the big picture regarding suffering. She saw how God would use (not cause) human troubles as a means of helping human beings to ―be partakers of His holiness‖ (Heb. 12:10). Though the suffering has been caused either by satanic intervention or by wrong human choices, God will intervene and help the sufferers find a blessing amidst the misery. She asked: ―How many there are who would never have known Jesus had not sorrow led them to seek comfort in Him! The trials of life are God‘s workmen, to remove the impurities and roughness from our character. . . . The Lord will work for all who put their trust in Him. Precious victories will be gained by the faithful. Precious lessons will be learned. Precious experiences will be realized.‖ mlxxii17 ―The trials of life‖ that
could destroy all hope are turned around by God, if He is asked, and made His ―workmen‖ for each person‘s spiritual growth. Jesus spoke of another kind of suffering not caused by human disobedience to the laws of life—the frequent fallout of serving righteousness (Matt. 5:10). Paul referred to this kind of suffering: ―Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution‖ (2 Tim. 3:12). In many comforting and ennobling ways, Ellen White put suffering for truth‘s sake in its proper perspective: ―God never leads His children otherwise than they would choose to be led, if they could see the end from the beginning, and discern the glory of the purpose which they are fulfilling as coworkers with Him. Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who ascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or more honored than John the Baptist, who perished alone in the dungeon. . . . And of all the gifts that Heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty trust and the highest honor.‖ mlxxiii18 Light for the Heathen In providing the big picture, the Great Controversy Theme helps us to understand the plight of the heathen (at all times, in all places on earth, in all social and economic strata). God is the waiting Father who chooses to have all His children return home; in fact, He is persistently seeking them with wooing invitations that vary from person to person because of varying capabilities and circumstances. He knows where everyone lives, He knows their names. Everyone, in some way, receives some light from our heavenly Father‘s front door (John 1:9). Everyone has enough light to make a moral decision. Ellen White caught this higher view that has not often been present in the Christian world: ―Wherever there is an impulse of love and sympathy, wherever the heart reaches out to bless and uplift others, there is revealed the working of God‘s Holy Spirit. In the depths of heathenism, men who have had no knowledge of the written law of God, who have never even heard the name of Christ, have been kind to His servants, protecting them at the risk of their own lives. Their acts show the working of a divine power. The Holy Spirit has implanted the grace of Christ in the heart of the savage, quickening his sympathies contrary to his nature, contrary to his education. The ‗Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world‘ (John 1:9), is shining in his soul; and this light, if heeded, will guide his feet to the kingdom of God.‖ mlxxiv19 Eschatology The study of the end-time (the end of the world as we now know it and the events that precede the return of Jesus) is a subject that has been given much attention in recent times, especially in the evangelical churches. The Second Advent of Christ is one of the defining doctrines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
271 However, no other church looks at the Second Advent the same way as do Adventists. mlxxv20 The distinctly Adventist view is formed by a ―mutually supportive cluster‖ of ideas. This ―cluster‖ includes ―conditional immortality, seventh-day Sabbatarianism, a premillennial historicist eschatology that emphasizes the imminence [nearness] of the Second Coming, acceptance of the gift of prophecy in the ministry of Ellen White, and teachings about the priestly work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. These doctrines coalesce into a distinctive eschatological theme, which lies at the heart of Adventism.‖ mlxxvi21 “Conflict of the Ages” Series
This ―mutually supportive cluster‖ of ideas that marks Adventist eschatology exists today because of the writings of Ellen White. Each book in the five-volume Conflict of the Ages series presents a particular aspect of the Great Controversy Theme. The first, Patriarchs and Prophets, reveals the origin and nature of sin and how it affects the universe as well as planet earth. Prophets and Kings
traces the controversy as truth survives even during Israel‘s defeats, backslidings, captivity, and reformations; it shows that God‘s side of the conflict can still be given during apparent defeat and captivity. The Desire of Ages focuses on the purpose of Christ‘s incarnation and why His life and death were the supreme display of God‘s love and justice. The Acts of the Apostles unfolds the marvelous manifestation of God‘s Spirit in the life of men and women who found in the life and death of Jesus a new power that regenerated and ennobled those who gladly followed His ―way.‖ The last book in the series, The Great Controversy Between Christ and Satan, answers the great questions of how long the controversy will last, how it will end, and why the questions that started the controversy will be settled forever. The latter part of this volume focuses on the ―end-times‖ and how the destiny of all will be affected by each person‘s response to Bible truth. In no book by any other author can be found Ellen White‘s ―mutually supportive cluster‖ of ideas, all interdependent. Note how interdependent, unambiguous, relevant, and totally reflective of actual events (excepting those yet to take place on the time-sequence line) are the chapters, ―Modern Revivals,‖ ―The Investigative Judgment,‖ ―Snares of Satan,‖ ―Spiritualism,‖ ―Aims of the Papacy,‖ ―The Impending Conflict,‖ ―The Scriptures a Safeguard,‖ ―The Final Warning,‖ and ―The Time of Trouble.‖ This eschatologically focused volume draws together Ellen White‘s first forty years of comment on last-day events. In 1851 she wrote: ―Such subjects as the sanctuary, in connection with the 2300 days, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, are perfectly calculated to explain the past Advent movement and show what our present position is, establish the faith of the doubting, and give certainty to the glorious future. These, I have frequently seen, were the principal subjects on which the messengers [Adventist preachers] should dwell.‖ mlxxvii22 But the Adventist emphasis was not to be on mere prophetic interpretation. Ellen White strongly affirmed that the third angel‘s message was ―the soul-purifying truth for this time.‖ mlxxviii23 The Laodicean Message In the early years after the 1844 experience, Sabbatarian Adventists identified themselves as the church of Philadelphia, other Adventists as Laodiceans, and non-Adventists as Sardis. mlxxix24 However, by 1854 Ellen White was led to point out that ―the remnant were not prepared for what is coming upon the earth. Stupidity, like lethargy, seemed to hang upon the minds of most of those who profess to believe that we are having the last message. . . . Ye suffer your minds to be diverted too readily from the work of preparation and
272 the all-important truths for these last days.‖ mlxxx25 By 1856 James White, Uriah Smith, and J. H. Waggoner were clearly telling the young Adventist groups that the Laodicean message applied to Sabbatarian Adventists as well as others who were ―lukewarm‖ in their Christian experience. They, too, needed thorough repentance. Further, they combined in their conclusion that the third angel‘s message was the final message to the ―rebellious world,‖ and the Laodicean message was the final message to a ―lukewarm church.‖ mlxxxi26 Anti-Triumphal Self-Understanding This anti-triumphal self-understanding stirred Sabbatarian Adventists to renewed missionary activity, hoping thus to hasten the Advent. However, most church members heard the mission emphasis without the deeper implication: ―The heart must be purified from sins which have so long shut out Jesus . . . . But as they failed to see the powerful work accomplished in a short time, many lost the effect of the [Laodicean] message. . . . It is designed to arouse the people of God, to discover to them their backslidings, and to lead to zealous repentance, that they may be favored with the presence of Jesus, and be fitted for the loud cry of the third angel.‖ mlxxxii27
One of Ellen White‘s consistent themes is that character preparation is needed before God can endorse the church‘s missionary efforts with the latter rain experience and the resulting ―loud cry‖ world-shaking interventions just before the Advent: ―If the message had been of as short duration as
many of us supposed, there would have been no time for them to develop character. Many moved from feeling, not from principle and faith. . . . It wrought upon their feelings, and excited their fears, but did not accomplish the work which God designed that it should.‖ mlxxxiii28 In this same chapter, ―The Laodicean Church,‖ Mrs. White gave candid counsel regarding what the Laodicean message needed to accomplish if members of the last-day church were to complete their assignment as the proclaimers of the three angels‘ messages. She emphasized that those who apply the message to their lives will be ―purified through obeying the truth‖: they will have stood ―every test, and overcome, be the price what it may‖: they will ―have heeded the counsel of the True Witness [Laodicean message].‖ When God‘s people have fully cooperated with the Lord who stands at the door, when, by the enabling power of the ―indwelling Christ,‖ God‘s people will ―overcome . . . as I also overcame and sat down with my Father on His throne‖ (Rev. 3:21), then ―they will receive the latter rain, and thus be fitted for translation.‖ mlxxxiv29 ―This antitriumphalism in the Laodicean context has continued to be an important factor in the Adventist theology of mission up till the present. It has not only improved the spiritual climate for mission work but has also provided a rationale for the delay of the parousia [Second Advent].‖ mlxxxv30 Because of Ellen White‘s eschatological teachings, Adventists think differently about the return of Jesus than do other Christians. They know that ―certain events in the history of salvation‖ must yet occur. mlxxxvi31 Using the Elijah motif, mlxxxvii32 a special emphasis was placed on the work of restoration as a specific burden of the third angel‘s message. One of these specific burdens was the place that health reform would serve in preparing a people for fulfilling their spiritual responsibilities. mlxxxviii33 Sanctification Interacting With Last-day Events Another emphasis embedded in the third angel‘s message is the principle that ―the Christian is in the world as a representative of Christ, for the salvation of other souls.‖ The purpose of character development is to prepare Christians for
273 the latter rain and the ―loud cry‖ (Rev. 18:4) when God steps in to greatly enhance the impact and credibility of the third angel‘s message. Ellen White graphically depicts the Christian‘s primary privilege: ―Christ is seeking to reproduce Himself in the hearts of men; and He does this through those who believe in Him. The object of the Christian life is fruit-bearing—the reproduction of Christ‘s character in the believer, that it may be reproduced in others.‖ mlxxxix34 The Great Controversy Theme informs all areas of Ellen White‘s thought. Every area, because it unfolds out of this organizing principle, is coherent and interactive with all other areas. For example, her understanding of sanctification is thoroughly interactive with last-day events. As we will note later, her profound emphasis on the Adventist health message interacts with both sanctification and last-day events. mxc35 Sanctification relates to eschatology not only in terms of each person‘s moment of death but also in terms of the generation alive when Jesus returns. Sanctification prepares the Christian to be ―safe‖ to save, mxci36 for the latter rain, mxcii37 and for translation. mxciii38 The principle is transparent throughout her writings: ―Character cannot be changed when Christ comes, nor just as a man is about to die. Character building must be done in this life.‖ mxciv39 Key to Perception of Truth The Great Controversy Theme provides the conceptual framework for an understanding of epistemology—how we learn, the process of knowing. Along with the knowledge that human beings are free moral agents comes the awareness that two loyalties are in conflict—allegiance to God, or loyalty to self and Satan‘s kingdom of evil.
Since Plato and Aristotle, men and women have proposed a variety of suggestions as to how knowledge is acquired, most of them contradictory. In reference to salvation truth, Ellen White lucidly taught that ―the perception and appreciation of truth . . . depends less upon the mind than upon the heart.‖ mxcv40 She based her insights on Christ‘s teaching: ―If anyone wants to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority‖ (John 7:17). What does this mean—the heart determines the perception of truth? The conflict of loyalties in the Great Controversy directly affects how people perceive truth! The Reformers grasped this concept when they distinguished three aspects of faith: cognition, assent, and trust. Without assent and trust, theology would be a mere intellectual exercise; without cognition, feelings would be the master and the door would be open to individual whim. Ellen White would agree with Calvin when he wrote that ―all right knowledge of God is born of obedience.‖ mxcvi41 Defining this thought further, she wrote that the reception of truth ―depends upon the renunciation of every sin that the Spirit of God reveals.‖ mxcvii42 A mind using the scientific method alone, for example, will fail ―to understand the things of God. . . . Only the mind and heart cleansed by the sanctification of the Spirit can discern heavenly things.‖ mxcviii43 Thus, not by reason or historical research alone can salvation truth be discovered. Ellen White emphasized: ―A knowledge of the truth depends not so much upon strength of intellect as upon pureness of purpose, the simplicity of an earnest, dependent faith.‖ mxcix44 A spinoff of the practical aspect of this ―knowing‖ principle occurred in the 1888-1901 period. Helping the church to come to a peaceful and constructive agreement regarding the ―two laws‖ in Galatians, she maintained that ―it is not so essential to understand the precise particulars in regard to the relation of the two laws. It is of far greater consequence that we know whether we are transgressing the law of God, whether we stand in obedience
274 or disobedience before the holy precepts.‖ mc45 Rebellion Rarely Curable Closely connected to the principle that the heart [human desire] determines the way the head perceives ―truth,‖ is the phenomenon of rebellion. Rebellion means that a person who once knew truth, to some degree, chooses no longer to perceive it as ―truth.‖ Some personal, internal conflict has arisen that is in conflict with the obligations of ―truth.‖ In terms of the Great Controversy, such persons have made their own judgment the ―lord‖ of their lives. For all of us, we must move on from the limited knowledge of the past to the fuller knowledge of unfolding truth. At those moments we should abide by our consciences and move on, with head and heart united, in responding to the higher demand of truth. The committed Christian makes a habit of responding to ―known duty.‖ mci46 Rebellion, however, is a turning away from ―known duty,‖ from that advancing light—rebelling at the increasing demand of the lordship of truth. No one other than the person involved knows when that first rebellious thought arises. Neither does one know when someone else crosses the line in letting thoughtful reflection become rationalization. But rationalizers who seek reasons to justify their reluctance to accept all the implications of truth know when that intoxicating spirit of rebellion takes over. It then becomes a slippery slope. In reflecting on the experience of Australian Pastor Stephen McCullagh mcii47 in the 1890s, Ellen White wrote: ―I question whether genuine rebellion is ever curable.‖ mciii48 The issue in rebellion is primarily attitude—an attitude that determines and governs the way a person looks at information. Rebellion happens when a person changes allegiance—a change that he or she may not recognize intellectually. Mrs. White used Korah‘s rebellion against Moses as an example of an incurable rebellion, even as she did Satan‘s rebellion in heaven. mciv49
The anatomy of rebellion is this: ―jealousy [gives] rise to envy, and envy to rebellion.‖ mcv50 The heart of rebellion is self-will set against the expressed will of God. The appeal of a rebellion is that
people have ―been deprived of their liberty and independence,‖ and that relief will be found by joining the rebellion. mcvi51 The methodology of rebellion is to whisper half-truths and to dissemble when confronted; those whom the rebels oppose are vilified and ―represented in the blackest character.‖ mcvii52 Why is it that rebellion is not easily cured by the light of truth? Because incurable rebellion rests on a refusal to submit to divine authority. Pride of opinion rises up to shade the light of truth. In Korah‘s rebellion, his followers ―fondly cherished the hope that a new order of things was about to be established, in which praise would be substituted for reproof, and ease for anxiety and conflict. . . . It is hardly possible for men to offer greater insult to God than to despise and reject the instrumentalities He would use for their salvation.‖ mcviii53 After the death of the rebel leaders, God gave those who had been deceived by their dead leaders time to think and to come to their senses. How did they spend the night? By ―devising some way to resist the evidences which showed them to be the greatest of sinners. They still cherished hatred of the men of God‘s appointment, and braced themselves to resist their authority.‖ mcix54 Again, the rebels selected from the evidences of truth those notions that pleased their hearts. Ellen White saw how the rebellion of Korah was a repeat of Satan‘s ambition for position and honor in heaven. But she saw more: ―All through the history of the church, God‘s servants have had the same spirit to meet.‖ How does this ―spirit‖ take hold of a
275 person? Ellen White was unequivocal: ―By sinful indulgence . . . men give Satan access to their minds. . . . The rejection of light darkens the mind and hardens the heart, so that it is easier for them to take the next step in sin and to reject still clearer light, until at last their habits of wrongdoing become fixed.‖ mcx55 What are the first signals of a rebel spirit? ―They [rebels] are ready to pervert the truth, falsifying and misrepresenting the Lord‘s servants, and even charging them with the base and selfish motives that inspire their own hearts. By persistently reiterating falsehood, and that against all evidence, they at last come to believe it to be truth. While endeavoring to destroy the confidence of the people in the men of God‘s appointment, they really believe that they are engaged in good work, verily doing God service.‖ mcxi56 Ellen White recognized that one thing that helps create the rebel heart is unwillingness ―to endure the pain and sacrifice necessary to reform.‖ Thus, one of the rebel‘s key motives is to soothe the conscience by ―turn[ing] upon the Lord‘s servant, and [denouncing] his reproofs as uncalled for and severe.‖ Mrs. White saw the thread of rebellion from Moses‘ day through the Reformation to our day: ―Every advance made by those whom God has called to lead in His work, has excited suspicion; every act has been misrepresented by the jealous and fault-finding. Thus it was in the time of Luther, of the Wesleys, and other reformers. Thus it is today.‖ mcxii57 Rebellion becomes incurable when the ―weight of evidence‖ is continually rejected, when habits of self-justification are so deeply etched in the neural pathways that light and darkness change places. Ellen White wrote that closing the mind to the light because of heart preferences is to sin against the Holy Spirit, ―a sin by which man‘s heart is effectually hardened against the influence of divine grace.‖ The Spirit does not leave principally because He feels offended, although that is a factor (Eph. 4:30; 1 Thess. 5:19); He leaves because He no longer can break through the rebel‘s defenses against the truth. God has no more ―reserve power.‖ mcxiii58 The principle of the Great Controversy is working itself out: God does not coerce anyone to believe against his/her will. God will provide ―the most convincing evidence‖ mcxiv59 but He will leave the decision finally up to men and women. Rebels supplant the Lordship of God with the kingship of their own desires. Because His character is opposed to coercion God respects freedom, even for created beings who choose to rebel.
Chapter 24—Health Principles-Part 1: Emergence of a Health Message
“Through it all [the development and history of Seventh-day Adventist health principles and medical practice] we see the guidance of God as projected by the little lady from Elmshaven. At strategic moments in the development of our medical work, this remarkable woman gave the encouragement and wise counsel needed to keep the program balanced and moving forward.” mcxv1 Because of her understanding of the Great Controversy Theme, Ellen White saw the implications involved in humanity‘s indivisible unity of body, mind, and spirit. Not only were human beings ―free moral agents,‖ mcxvi2 the interacting, integrating components of body, mind, and spirit required the health of each component so that all the components would function effectively. Without the wellbeing of this synergy, the human being would soon suffer and hasten the slide to death. mcxvii3 Interaction a Spiritual Matter In 1875 Ellen White called this interaction between mind and body ―a mysterious and wonderful relation. They react upon each other.‖ Further, she made this profound concept intensely practical: ―It cannot be to the glory of God for His children to have sickly bodies or dwarfed minds.‖ mcxviii4 One may ask, why do ―sickly bodies or dwarfed minds,‖ as a general rule, have anything to do with ―the glory of God‖? Ellen White is consistent and wholistic: ―Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind, and makes it less capable of discriminating between right and wrong. We become less capable of choosing the good, and have less strength of will to do that which we know to be right.‖ mcxix5 The question is: How did Mrs. White develop her expansive, wholistic contribution to health awareness, an emphasis that has become more relevant as the years pass? Was her distinctive formulation of health principles developed in a mind hermetically sealed from the world around her and penetrated by the Spirit alone? No, that is not how God works. mcxx6 Her theological understanding of the Great Controversy Theme provided the mental grid whereby she was able to recognize in the area of health and disease the fundamental and enduring wisdom of her age, and to reject that which would soon prove worthless. Emanating from this theological sense of wholeness flowed a distinctive and eventually coherent philosophy of health. This philosophy, in addition to clear insights by which millions of church members have ordered their personal lives, has spanned the earth with a singular system of health institutions. Nineteenth-Century Health Notions To better appreciate the distinctiveness of Ellen White‘s philosophy of health, let us review some of the prevailing health notions of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the century, a remarkably standardized pattern for the treatment of disease relied ―mostly on bleeding, purging, and polypharmacy.‖ mcxxi7
279 The cause of disease was a matter of widely diverse conjecture. The Christian world generally believed that illness and suffering were divinely inflicted because of sin. Healing, if possible, was the result of prayer and faith. But new ideas were surfacing in the early 1800s. Horace Mann, in his famous 1842 report to the Massachusetts school authorities, wrote that suffering was ―no part of the ordination of a merciful Providence, but to be directly chargeable to human ignorance and error.‖ Further, if people would obey ―the physical laws of God, they would no more suffer pain than they would suffer remorse, or moral pain, if in all things they would obey the moral laws of God.‖ mcxxii8
But changing the source of disease from heaven to earth did not automatically explain its cause. Mann, for example, rejected the idea of an invading, foreign body. Contemporaries blamed various causes, including variations in body fluids, filth and odors as found in garbage and sewage, and stimuli, either too much or too little. For many medical specialists, health was an intermediate state of
excitement, and the physician‘s task was to adjust the excitement level. Whenever people occasionally raised the possibility that nature itself contained healing powers, as Hippocrates long before had believed, they were ―confronted with the almost uniform opposition of the regular medical practitioners, who labeled them as empiric rustics attempting to restore a discredited element of primitive medicine.‖ mcxxiii9 The ―stimuli‖ theory, probably the prevailing treatment of disease, became known as ―heroic‖ medicine. Benjamin Rush (1745?-1813), dean of American physicians, actively promoted this popular treatment wherein the sick had to resign themselves to ―massive bloodletting, considered a panacea for almost every problem, and to submit to the violent purgatives and emetics which the medical doctors administered.‖ The physician‘s task was to ―conquer nature‖ with a special drug, the more violent the better, for each disease. George Washington became a well-known victim of deadly conventional medicine during the first half of the nineteenth century. mcxxiv10 In 1860 Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, professor of anatomy at Harvard University, wrote that ―if the whole materia medica, as now used, could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for mankind—and all the worse for the fishes.‖ mcxxv11 The second quarter of the nineteenth century, often known as the Jacksonian era, was swamped with innovation and change in most all areas of American life. Emotional, human-centered ideas overtook the rational, classical order of the preceding century. Fresh optimism and the sense of equality of all human beings inspired ―reforms‖ in such areas as education, prisons, abolition of slavery, women‘s rights, politics, and health. mcxxvi12 This new focus on the individual and away from traditional theories was thoroughly evident in the remarkably fresh concern for personal health. mcxxvii13 Distrust of traditional medicine with its ―heroic‖ treatments and pitiful results turned the minds of many in all classes to what could be done with common sense. mcxxviii14 In this exhilarating era of optimism and its new focus on the ―common man,‖ such health reform movements as the following sprang up everywhere: The temperance movement, mcxxix15 promotion of vegetarianism, mcxxx16 public renunciation of ―all evil habits,‖ (tobacco, alcoholic beverages, tea, coffee, etc.), mcxxxi17 development of ―physiological‖ societies, mcxxxii18 emphasis on public health, including sanitation and hospitals, mcxxxiii19 new attention to fashion, mcxxxiv20 and the emergence of ―water‖ treatments. mcxxxv21 Physical Afflictions of Early Adventists Early Adventists were as physically afflicted as their contemporaries. Many of them, fearful of the prevailing medical
280 practice, turned to prayer as their best hope. In 1846 Otis Nichols wrote to William Miller about young Ellen White: ―The Spirit of God is with her and has been in a remarkable manner in healing the sick through the answer of her prayers; some cases are as remarkable as any that are recorded in the New Testament.‖ mcxxxvi22 Dramatic Healings Ellen and James White participated in many dramatic healings within their own family. But they did not consider the use of natural remedies to indicate lack of faith. From her early years to her last, Mrs. White clearly warned against fanaticism: ―We believe in the prayer of faith; but some have carried this matter too far . . . . Some have taken the strong ground that it was wrong to use simple remedies. We have never taken this position, but have opposed it. We believe it to be perfectly right to use the remedies God has placed in our reach, and if these fail, apply to the great Physician, and in some cases the counsel of an earthly physician is very necessary. This position we have always held.‖ mcxxxvii23
In 1854 she visited a ―celebrated physician in Rochester‖ for a painful swelling on her left eyelid that was diagnosed as cancer. But the physician told her that she would die of apoplexy before the cancer would kill her! About a month later, after much trust and prayer, she suddenly was healed of both the cancerous eyelid and the oppressive heart condition that had made breathing difficult. mcxxxviii24 First Health-minded Adventist Joseph Bates, that indefatigable former sea captain, seemed to be the first and, for some time, the only Adventist leader who had come to terms with health principles and the cause of disease. On the basis of observation and personal experience, he had decided in 1824 (at the age of 32) to abstain ―from all intoxicating drinks.‖ Earlier, he had given up tobacco in all forms. After another seven years, he determined not to drink tea or coffee. Probably the lectures of Sylvester Graham, who had written that ―both tea and coffee are among the most powerful poisons of the vegetable kingdom,‖ confirmed his observations. mcxxxix25 By 1843 Bates had given up flesh food. mcxl26 However, though a staunch Millerite and later an energetic apostle of the seventh-day Sabbath, Bates apparently was not a health-reforming evangelist. He did not write out his strong health-reform beliefs nor personally try to persuade his associates. mcxli27 But he was very successful, through his Sabbath pamphlet, in convincing James and Ellen White in 1846 that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. Thereafter, Bates and the Whites were intrepid leaders of the ―scattered flock.‖ Ellen White’s Early Awareness of Health Principles As early as 1848 Ellen White was shown the harmful effects of tobacco, tea, and coffee. mcxlii28 Some church members were not easily convinced regarding tobacco. In an 1851 letter she responded to the question as to whether she had seen ―in vision‖ that it was wrong to use tobacco: ―I have seen in vision that tobacco was a filthy weed, and that it must be laid aside or given up.‖ She wrote encouraging letters to those who struggled to break the tobacco habit. mcxliii29 But diet was another matter for the Whites. Many lifestyle changes had already been made within a few short years. The introduction of further change, such as self-denial in dietary habits, would have been enormously distracting and a source of much division among these early Sabbath keeping church members. Achieving doctrinal unity was more important for early Sabbatarian Adventists. Such unity established the spiritual climate for the more personal tests that would be introduced later. mcxliv30
281 The issue of eating swine‘s flesh is a good example of an important Biblical concept that had to wait until a church was ready for its significance. Some had contended as early as 1850 that the Bible definitely forbids eating swine‘s flesh, but James White thought that some of the Biblical reasoning was inappropriate: ―We do object to a misapplication of the Holy Scriptures in sustaining a position which will only distract the flock of God, and lead the minds of the brethren from the importance of the present work of God among the remnant.‖ mcxlv31 By 1858 the issue was being zealously pushed by the Haskells, to whom Ellen White wrote this interesting counsel: ―I saw that your views concerning swine‘s flesh would prove no injury if you have them to yourselves; but in your judgment and opinion you have made this question a test, and your actions have plainly shown your faith in this matter. . . . If it is the duty of the church to abstain from swine‘s flesh, God will discover it to more than two or three. He will teach His church their duty. . . . I saw that the angels of God would lead His people no faster than they could receive and act upon the important truths that are communicated to them.‖ mcxlvi32
The Whites were not ready to take positions unless they had the clearest Biblical evidence or a clear word from the Lord through a vision. Up to the health vision of June 6, 1863, they believed that the dietary restrictions set forth in Leviticus 11 as part of the Jewish ceremonial laws, were no longer
applicable since the Cross. During the 1850s, Adventists freely ate pork. After the June 6 vision, the issue of eating swine‘s flesh was settled among Seventh-day Adventists. Why? Ellen White now wrote with vision-certainty: ―God never designed the swine to be eaten under any circumstances. . . . The eating of pork has produced scrofula [derived from the Latin word for a breeding sow, a term for tuberculosis of the lymph nodes], leprosy, and cancerous humors [blood or lymph fluids]. Pork-eating is still causing the most intense suffering to the human race.‖ mcxlvii33 Ellen White had been suggesting for a decade other aspects of healthful living that cut across the general habits of almost everyone. In 1854, at a time when modern conveniences were not even thought of, she called for cleanliness among those professing Christianity: ―I saw that the houses of the saints should be kept tidy and neat, free from dirt and filth and all uncleanness.‖ Turning to maintaining health, especially in dietary matters, she wrote that we must ―take special care of the health that God has given us. . . . Deny the unhealthy appetite, eat less fine food, eat coarse food free from grease. Then as you sit at the table to eat you can from the heart ask God‘s blessing upon the food and can derive strength from coarse, wholesome food.‖ mcxlviii34 The Health Vision of 1863 On May 21, 1863, at Battle Creek, Seventh-day Adventists organized themselves under a General Conference that unified their scattered churches. For the first time they had a center that promised unity and efficiency in their missionary outreach. About two weeks later, on June 6, 1863, Ellen White was given the epochal health vision in Otsego, Michigan. mcxlix35 It seems that God waited until the church had completed its organizational struggles before giving them the next step in their assignment—a responsibility that required unity of spirit and a general sense of harmony in doctrinal matters. James White may have said it best when he reflected in 1870 on how the Lord had been leading the ―scattered flock‖ into becoming a transcontinental movement. Although his sentiments could be applied as well to their doctrinal development in the earlier years, he contemplated the growing unity around the health messages: ―The Lord also knew
282 how to introduce to His waiting people the great subject of health reform, step by step, so they could bear it, and make a good use of it, without souring the public mind. It was twenty-two years ago [1848] the present autumn, that our minds were called to the injurious effects of tobacco, tea, and coffee, through the testimony of Mrs. White. God has wonderfully blessed the effort to put these things away from us, so that we as a denomination can rejoice in victory, with very few exceptions, over these pernicious indulgences of appetite. . . . When we had gained a good victory over these things, and when the Lord saw that we were able to bear it, light was given relative to food and dress.‖ mcl36 Led Step by Step Psychologically, it could not have been otherwise. It was the method of Jesus: ―I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now‖ (John 16:12). People cannot relate to too much change at once. Early Adventists proclaimed the seventh-day Sabbath at a time when a six-day work week was common, and to get Sabbath privileges was virtually impossible. Their enthusiastic announcement of a very near Second Coming seemed farfetched to their neighbors who remembered the Millerite embarrassment in 1844. To declare further, in those early years, that Adventist Christians should not smoke tobacco, drink alcoholic beverages, use tea and coffee, or eat swine‘s flesh—would have been too much to contemplate. Change takes time, even today. And now the Otsego health vision. Many items in it were extremely relevant to the Whites themselves as to how they could improve their health by setting better priorities for their time and energies, by a more ―cheerful, hopeful, peaceful frame of mind,‖ and by not leaving their own health care to God ―to take care of that which He has left for us to watch and care for.‖
Further, the Lord instructed the Whites and others to speak out ―against intemperance of every kind . . . in working, in eating, in drinking, and in drugging.‖ But they were not to have only a negative message. They were to guide Seventh-day Adventists and others to a life style that harmonized with the laws of the spiritual and natural world. The sweep of the vision ―astonished‖ Ellen White. She wrote: ―Many things came directly across my own ideas.‖ mcli37 In May 1866, she visited Dr. H. S. Lay, an Adventist physician in Allegan, Michigan. Fascinated with her vision summary, he wanted a full interview. Mrs. White responded reluctantly because she ―was not familiar with medical language,‖ and because ―much of the matter presented to her was so different from the commonly accepted views that she feared she could not relate it so that it would be understood.‖ mclii38 Dr. Lay was impressed. Her insights were accurate and the overall coherency profound. He knew that the interacting nature of these principles did not come from human sources. He often related to others what he learned that day. One of his medical friends with whom he much later shared this special information was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. In 1897 Dr. Kellogg said: ―It is a very interesting fact that the Lord began giving us this light thirty years ago. Just before I came to the Conference I had a talk with Dr. Lay, and he told me of how he heard the first instruction about health reform away back in 1860 and especially in 1863. While he was riding in a carriage with Brother and Sister White, she related what had been presented to her upon the subject of health reform, and laid out the principles which have stood the test of all these years—a whole generation.‖ mcliii39 Speaking to the assembled delegates at the 1897 General Conference, Dr. Kellogg added: ―It is impossible for any man who has not made a special study of medicine to appreciate the wonderful character of
283 the instruction that has been received in these writings. It is wonderful, brethren, when you look back over the writings that were given us thirty years ago, and then perhaps the next day pick up a scientific journal and find some new discovery that the microscope has made, or that has been brought to light in the chemical laboratory—I say, it is perfectly wonderful how correctly they agree in fact. . . . There is not a single principle in relation to the healthful development of our bodies and minds that is advocated in these writings from Sister White, which I am not prepared to demonstrate conclusively from scientific evidence.‖ mcliv40 While traveling on a brutal schedule, still mourning the sad death of Henry, their firstborn, Ellen White rushed to completion Spiritual Gifts, volumes 3 and 4. Volume 4 contained a section called ―Health,‖ which contained the first comprehensive statement on health principles since the Otsego vision. Were Adventists ready for this next call for personal reform? So many orders were received that an announcement was made in the Review and Herald, August 23, 1864: ―The call for Spiritual Gifts is so great that we are unable to fill orders as soon as they are received. We have two binders at work, but today have not a single copy in the office.‖ Reports of immediate and beneficial results began to pour into the Review and Herald, the Adventist clearing house for information. Pastor Isaac Sanborn wrote that for ten years he had tried many remedies for his inflammatory rheumatism. Then, in the spring of 1864 he gave up pork, and a few months later he adopted a two-meal-a-day program, without meat of any kind. He joyfully reported: ―I enjoy as perfect health as probably can be enjoyed in this mortal state. I would not return to my old habits of eating for any consideration. . . . I thank God for the light He has given upon this subject.‖ mclv41 M. E. Cornell recounted how his wife lay at the point of death with typhoid: ―We knew that to take the drugs of physicians would be in this case certain death.‖ They applied hydrotherapy treatments, giving ―nature a chance to throw off the disease.‖ In a short while, as they united in prayer, Mrs. Cornell was out of danger. mclvi42
Ellen White was forthright about the changes that had come to her as she applied the counsel she passed on to others, counsel that ―came directly across my own ideas.‖ In her ―Health‖ article, one year after the vision, she wrote: ―Since the Lord presented before me, in June, 1863, the subject of
meat-eating in relation to health, I have left the use of meat. For a while it was rather difficult to bring my appetite to bread, for which, formerly, I have had but little relish. But by persevering, I have been able to do this. I have lived for nearly one year without meat. For about six months most of the bread upon our table has been unleavened cakes, made of unbolted wheat meal and water, and a very little salt. We use fruits and vegetables liberally. I have lived for eight months upon two meals a day.‖ mclvii43 Ingredients of the Otsego Health Vision What was so electrifying, so sweeping, so full of promise in the Otsego health vision? mclviii44 The 33 core principles were: 1. Those who do not control their appetite in eating are guilty of intemperance. 2. Swine‘s flesh is not to be eaten under any circumstance. 3. Tobacco in any form is a slow poison. 4. Strict cleanliness of the body and home premises is important. 5. Tea and coffee, similar to tobacco, are slow poisons. 6. Rich cake, pies, and puddings are injurious. 7. Eating between meals injures the stomach and digestive process. 8. Adequate time must be allowed between meals, giving the stomach time to rest. 9. If a third meal is taken, it should be
284 light and several hours before bedtime. 10. People used to meat, gravies, and pastries do not immediately relish a plain, wholesome diet. 11. Gluttonous appetite contributes to indulgence of corrupt passions. 12. Turning to a plain, nutritious diet may overcome the physical damage caused by a wrong diet. 13. Reforms in eating will save expense and labor. 14. Children eating flesh meat and spicy foods have strong tendencies toward sexual indulgences. 15. Poisonous drugs used as medical prescriptions kill more people than all other causes of death combined. 16. Pure water should be used freely in maintaining health and curing illnesses. 17. Nature alone has curative powers. 18. Common medicines, such as strychnine, opium, calomel, mercury, and quinine, are poisons. 19. Parents transmit their weaknesses to their children; prenatal influences are enormous. 20. Obeying the laws of health will prevent many illnesses. 21. God is too often blamed for deaths caused by violation of nature‘s laws. 22. Light and pure air are required, especially in the sleeping quarters. 23. Bathing, even a sponge bath, will be beneficial on rising in the morning. 24. God will not work healing miracles for those who continually violate the laws of health. 25. Many invalids have no physical cause for their illness; they have a diseased imagination. 26. Cheerful, physical labor will help to create a healthy, cheerful disposition. 27. Willpower has much to do with resisting disease and soothing nerves. 28. Outdoor exercise is very important to health of mind and body. 29. Overwork breaks down both mind and body; routine daily rest is necessary. 30. Many die of disease caused wholly by eating flesh food. 31. Caring for health is a spiritual matter, reflecting a person‘s commitment to God. 32. A healthy mind and body directly affects one‘s morals and one‘s ability to discern truth. 33. All God‘s promises are given on condition of obedience. Adventist Life Style
These fundamental principles became the clear, sensible, practical outline of what has become known worldwide as the Seventh-day Adventist life style. mclix45 Ellen White often amplified these
core principles, probably most clearly in her 1905 volume, The Ministry of Healing. One of her graphic statements that has galvanized millions is: ―Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power—these are the true remedies.‖ mclx46 For Adventists living in 1864, these health principles were indeed electrifying. Adventists had read and heard some of these principles before but not within Ellen White‘s spiritual context. Furthermore, Adventists now had a concise, coherent outline of health laws separated from the excesses and frivolities of others who were promoting life style changes. The Whites knew that Adventists would need all the help possible in educating themselves and others concerning the laws of life. James White used the church paper to draw attention to books and lecturers then available that would support his wife‘s first article on ―Health‖: ―Our people are generally waking up to the subject of health. . . . And they should have publications on the subject to meet their present wants, at prices within the reach of the poorest.‖ mclxi47 He was referring to books by Mann, Jackson, Trall, Coles, Lewis, Shew, Graham, Alcott, and others. mclxii48 For years these writers had been trying to get the attention of their world. Each of them emphasized certain aspects of healthful living that Ellen White recommended. But
285 their books were often technical, voluminous, costly, and, at times, merely personal opinion floating in oceans of verbiage. And none of them had placed healthful living within the context of the Third Angel‘s Message, preparing a people to meet the Lord. So innovative James White moved ahead with his usual enthusiasm. He announced that since Adventists had an urgent need for health literature ―to meet their present wants‖ and ―at prices within the reach of the poorest,‖ six pamphlets were being prepared and would be published under the title, Health, or How to Live. Mrs. White would ―furnish a liberal chapter in each number on health, happiness, and miseries of domestic life, and the bearing which these have upon the prospects of obtaining the life to come.‖ mclxiii49 The six ―chapters‖ unfolded the basic message of her earlier message, ―Health.‖ In addition, in the second article Ellen White wrote specific counsel regarding the relationship between husbands and wives and the proper care of infants and young children. In article four she gave added counsel to those who cared for the sick. New material on the subject of dress for women and children appeared in the fifth and sixth articles. mclxiv50
Chapter 25—Health Principles-Part 2: Relationship of Health to a Spiritual Mission “Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the Lord and depart from evil. It will be health to your flesh, and strength to your bones” (Prov. 3:7, 8). In their six pamphlets on health, the Whites deliberately included the writings of ―able and experienced health reformers in addition to Ellen White‘s articles.‖ mclxv1 Writing a few years later, James White said that the pamphlets were ―made up chiefly from the most spirited and valuable articles and extracts from Trall, Jackson, Graham, Dio Lewis, Coles, Horace Mann, Gunn, and many others. . . . This work was readable and well adapted to the wants of the people. It has also had a wide circulation outside of Seventh-day Adventists, and its influence for good in calling the attention of the people to the subject of health reform can hardly be estimated.‖ mclxvi2 In the first pamphlet, James White wrote the lead article, entitled, ―Sanctification.‖ He set the tone for the six-pamphlet set in connecting physical health with spiritual health. Toward the end of this article he said: ―To those who are active yet suffering from failing health we urgently recommend health publications, a good assortment of which we design to keep on hand. . . . To those who call themselves well, we would say: As you value the blessings of health, and would honor the Author of your being, learn to live in obedience to those laws established in your being by High Heaven.‖ mclxvii3
The articles written by other health reformers were used to buttress Ellen White‘s straightforward counsel. At the same time, she urged caution regarding certain notions or suggestions in those other
articles included in these six pamphlets, such as a warning that not all sick people may be strong enough for the heroics of cold-water therapy and heavy exercise for long periods of time. Ellen White avoided the notions of contemporary health reformers that were in conflict with the principles she had received in vision, such as the condemnation of salt, not only as wholly lacking in nutrition but also as indigestible. How many of these fundamental health principles had Adventists known and implemented in their lives prior to the Otsego vision? What was the result of this additional orbit of reform that those 3,500 Adventists now began to understand more clearly? Apart from Joseph Bates, who decided to be only a silent evangelist for health (see p. 280), very few had adopted any of these principles. Although these principles were discussed here and there, they surely did not represent the medical world in the mid-nineteenth century. And it seems just as certain that few Seventh-day Adventists had taken these reforms seriously prior to 1863. Several Adventist families (including Annie Smith, J. N. Loughborough, the
289 J. P. Kellogg family, and the J. N. Andrews family) seemed to have had some acquaintance with one or two of the contemporary advances, but the concept of total health eluded them until they got the coherent, spiritually motivated picture depicted by Ellen White. Some had tried hydrotherapy and used Graham bread. But their general life style, including the way they related to diet, exercise, cleanliness, and fresh air, was generally the same as that of other Americans. mclxviii4 Young Annie Smith While working at the publishing house in Rochester, New York, as one of James White‘s editorial assistants, Annie Smith contracted tuberculosis (a very common disease). Although, according to her mother, she made use of hydrotherapy treatments, the disease progressed rapidly, and she was dead in eight months. Very gifted and almost indispensable, she died in 1855 at the age of 27½. mclxix5 J. N. Loughborough’s Experience When J. N. Loughborough was 16, his uncle introduced him to ―Graham bread‖ and a certain kind of hydrotherapy that consisted of bathing in ice-cold water followed by vigorous exercise. His lungs were hemorrhaging and the remedy advised was to smoke tobacco! Writing about the incident years later, Loughborough added: ―This resort to cigar smoking shows how vague were our ideas of healthful living.‖ mclxx6 As a layman, Loughborough preached the doctrines of the First Day Adventists from 1849 to 1852. In 1852, when he was 20, he became a Seventh-day Adventist. In 1864, at age 32, he accompanied the Whites on a New England itinerary. He later wrote of this experience: ―I have been greatly benefited in this trip, not only by their instruction in spiritual things, but also by the excellent information they imparted on health, diet, etc. ―And here I would say, that the instruction I have received on health, I am trying to practice. For the short time I have been striving to live strictly in accordance with the laws of life, I have been greatly benefited. It is, however, about one year since I commenced a reform in relation to meat-eating. As I had been in the habit of using meat three times a day when I could get it, for the first two months I only ate meat twice a week. Then for a month, once a week. Then for three months once a month. And for the last four months no meat has passed my lips. And for the last two months I have eaten but two meals a day. Never was sleep sweeter, or health better, or my mind more cheerful, since I first started in the service of God at the age of 17 years, than for the last two months. ―With the short experience I have had, I would not, for any consideration, go back to the meat, spice, pepper, sweet cake, pickles, mustard, headache, stomachache and gloom, and give up the good wholesome fruit, grain, and vegetable diet, with pure cold water as a drink, no headaches, cheerfulness, happiness, vigor and health.
―But I do not urge these things upon others, or judge them about their meat. But I do esteem it a privilege to tell them what a temporal blessing I have found in this direction.‖ mclxxi7 The Andrews Family Angeline Andrews, scholarly John‘s wife, kept a diary for the years 1859-1864. An early entry noted the butchering of a pig. She referred to the death of a neighbor child who had a sore throat. The physician lanced it and gave him a dose of morphine, all of which contributed to his sudden death. In the fall of 1862, daughter Mary had whooping cough. Angeline wrapped the baby in wet sheets, attempting to reduce the fever. The local physician on several occasions administered an assortment of poisons such as ipecac, nitre, and quinine. The worried mother, still reaching out for help, received a recipe for syrup from her
290 sister. After giving the dose to Mary, she wrote: ―Mary has never been sicker than this afternoon. Medicine has no effect to vomit her as I supposed it would.‖ mclxxii8 After an article on healing diphtheria with simple water treatments that James White had reprinted in the church paper, mclxxiii9 it seems that the Andrews family became more interested in ―warm baths‖ in the treatment of illness. But other health reform notions were not evident in the Andrews family life. In July 1869, J. N. Andrews wrote: ―The subject of health reform has engaged my earnest attention for more than five years. During this entire period of time I have endeavored, as a matter of conscience, strictly to regard and live out the principles of this noble reform. As its effects upon myself have been very marked, and such that all with whom I have been associated for this period have observed them, I take pleasure in briefly stating my own experience.‖ mclxxiv10 In February 1872, he noted that the beginning of health reform for the Andrews family happened in March 1864. mclxxv11 A month later, he wrote specifically about his family‘s 1864 commitment when they put away ―spice, pepper, vinegar . . . butter, meat, fish, and substituted graham flour for fine floor.‖ In their place, they now ate ―plenty of good fruit, vegetables, grains,‖ and ―used some milk and a very little salt.‖ mclxxvi12 The Kellogg Family The John P. Kellogg family eagerly followed truth as fast as they discovered it. By 1852 they were observing the seventh-day Sabbath through the efforts of Joseph Bates. In 1852 Kellogg had joined three other Adventist stalwarts in proposing to James White that they would underwrite the move of the printing establishment from Rochester, New York, to Battle Creek, Michigan, with a donation of $300 apiece—a heavy sum from their meager assets. Later, Kellogg headed the list of subscribers for the first health institution of the Adventist Church. He fathered sixteen children, including Dr. Merritt Kellogg, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, and Will K. Kellogg, the cornflake king. The Kellogg family was at the heart of the growing Adventist work in the midwest. Family records indicate that the Kelloggs made good use of hydropathic methods. But apparently other aspects of health reform were either unknown or, if they were, their importance made no impact. Son John Harvey, born in 1852, recalled that two foods were his favorites in his childhood—ox tails nicely browned in the oven and the candy his father sold in the family store. In the Kellogg family cellar rested a keg of ale to be used ―for a weak stomach.‖ mclxxvii13
Dr. Kellogg put the question of ―who told Ellen White about health reform?‖ into sharp perspective when he wrote in 1890 in his preface to the book, Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene: ―Nearly thirty years ago there appeared in print the first of a series of remarkable and important articles on the subject of health, by Mrs. E. G. White. . . . Thousands were led to change life-long habits, and to renounce practices thoroughly fixed by heredity as well as by long indulgence. So great a revolution could not be wrought in a body of people, without the aid of some powerful incentive, which in this
case was undoubtedly the belief that the writings referred to not only bore the stamp of truth, but were endorsed as such by a higher than human authority. . . . ―At the time of the writings referred to first appeared, the subject of health was almost wholly ignored, not only by the people to whom they were addressed, but by the world at large. The few advocating the necessity of a reform in physical habits, propagated in connection with the advocacy of genuine reformatory principles the most patent and in some instances disgusting errors. ―Nowhere, and by no one, was there
291 presented a systematic and harmonious body of hygienic truths, free from patent errors, and consistent with the Bible and the principles of the Christian religion. ―Many of the principles taught have come to be so generally adopted and practiced that they are no longer recognized as reforms, and may, in fact, be regarded as prevalent customs among the more intelligent classes. The principles which a quarter of a century ago were either entirely ignored or made the butt of ridicule, have quietly won their way into public confidence and esteem, until the world has quite forgotten that they have not always been thus accepted. . . . ―It certainly must be regarded as a thing remarkable, and evincing unmistakable evidence of divine insight and direction, that in the midst of confused and conflicting teachings claiming the authority of science and experience, but warped by ultra notions and rendered impotent for good by the great admixture of error—it must be admitted to be something extraordinary, that a person making no claims to scientific knowledge or erudition should have been able to organize, from the confused and error-tainted mass of ideas advanced by a few writers and thinkers on health subjects, a body of hygienic principles so harmonious, so consistent, and so genuine that the discussions, the researches, the discoveries, and the experience of a quarter of a century have not resulted in the overthrow of a single principle, but have only served to establish the doctrines taught. ―The guidance of infinite wisdom is as much needed in the discerning between truth and error as in the evolution of new truths. Novelty is by no means a distinguishing characteristic of true principles, and the principle holds good as regards the truths of hygienic reform, as well as those of other reformatory movements. . . .‖ mclxxviii14 What should we make of Dr. Kellogg‘s unqualified endorsement of the impact of Ellen White‘s seminal health messages derived from her Otsego vision in 1863? Dr. Kellogg’s Endorsement In 1863 health reform was ―almost totally ignored‖ by Adventists and ―the world at large.‖ The few who were advocating ―reform‖ included with their insights ―the most patent and . . . disgusting errors.‖ No one before Ellen White‘s messages had presented ―a systematic and harmonious body of hygienic truths, free from patent errors, and consistent with the Bible and the principles of the Christian religion.‖ Thousands changed lifelong habits after reading these messages because they recognized not only the inherent harmony of these truths, but also their divine endorsement. Ellen White‘s principles have stood ―the test of time and experience.‖ Many of those principles, ridiculed or ignored in 1863, had become accepted in 1890. Remarkable scientific discoveries since 1863 had only strongly fortified those principles, without ―the overthrow of a single principle.‖ Divine guidance is ―as much needed‖ in distinguishing truth from error as ―in the evolution of new truths.‖ This nearly thirty-year record gives ―unmistakable evidence of divine insight and direction‖: in the midst of ―confused and conflicting teachings‖ whereby a person ―making no claims to scientific knowledge . . . should organize, from the confused and error-tainted mass of ideas a body of hygienic principles so harmonious, so consistent, and so genuine.‖
Linkage of the Health Message With the Gospel Commission Ellen White consistently linked the health emphasis with the ―third angel‘s message‖ as close as the ―hand is with the body.‖ mclxxix15 That is to say, the health message constituted a very important aspect
292 of the ―everlasting gospel‖ (Rev. 14:6). This fundamental linkage is based on three principles: The Humanitarian principle. In many ways, by example and teaching, Ellen White emphasized that the ―work of health reform is the Lord‘s means for lessening suffering in our world.‖ mclxxx16 The Evangelical principle. Ellen White was instructed (and her own experience validated the principle) that health reform is to be the bridge over which the gospel will meet people where they are. She called the health message a ―great entering wedge . . . the door through which the truth for this time is to find entrance to many homes . . . [It] will do much toward removing prejudice against our evangelical work.‖ mclxxxi17 Specifically, in regard to Adventist healthcare institutions, she wrote: ―The great object of receiving unbelievers into the institution [the sanitarium] is to lead them to embrace the truth.‖ mclxxxii18 The Soteriological principle. This third principle supplied the Adventist distinctive to nineteenth-century health reform: the Adventist emphasis on health was to help ―fit a people for the coming of the Lord.‖ ―He who cherishes the light which God has given upon health reform, has an important aid in the work of becoming sanctified through the truth, and fitted for immortality.‖ mclxxxiii19 This threefold linkage has not always been understood. Some made the health message an end in itself in developing a worldwide network of hospitals and clinics; others made the health message into a compelling public relations stratagem whereby non-Adventists would become interested enough to sit through an evangelistic sermon. Both were worthy uses of Adventist health principles—but short of the primary purpose that made Ellen White‘s health emphasis distinctive. The primary purpose was to join the spiritual and the physical on the practical, daily level of the average person. Health Principles and Spiritual Goals Ellen White was specific and practical as she applied the principles of the Great Controversy Theme to joining the spiritual with the physical and mental. Placing health matters within the intent of the Three Angels‘ Messages of Revelation 14 raised the health issue from personal opinion to the level of spiritual commitment and character development. Health principles were linked with spiritual goals: First duty to God and man is self-development. The following creative statement by Mrs. White has inspired many young people: ―Our first duty to God and our fellow beings is that of self-development. . . . Hence that time is spent to good account which is used in the establishment and preservation of physical and mental health. We cannot afford to dwarf or cripple any function of body or mind.‖ mclxxxiv20 Heart reform before health reform. Ellen White kept priorities straight—preserving health is primarily a spiritual challenge: ―Men will never be truly temperate until the grace of Christ is an abiding principle in the heart. . . . No mere restriction of your diet will cure your diseased appetite. . . . What Christ works within, will be worked out under the dictation of a converted intellect. The plan of beginning outside and trying to work inward has always failed, and always will fail.‖ mclxxxv21 Preparation for the latter rain and the loud cry. This application of health principles is profound and distinctively an Adventist insight. Ellen White wrote in 1867: ―God‘s people are not prepared for the loud cry of the third angel. They have a work to do for themselves which they should not leave for God to do for them. . . . Lustful appetite makes slaves of men and women, and beclouds their intellects and stupefies their moral sensibilities to such a degree that the sacred, elevated truths of God‘s Word are not appreciated. . . . In order to be fitted for translation,
293 the people of God must know themselves. . . . They should ever have the appetite in subjection to the moral and intellectual organs.‖ mclxxxvi22 Health closely linked with sanctification. Ellen White was not hesitant in pointing to the direct relationship between daily habits and character development: ―A diseased body and disordered intellect, because of continual indulgence in hurtful lust, make sanctification of the body and spirit impossible.‖ mclxxxvii23 Further, for ―those who have received instruction regarding the evils of the use of ―flesh foods, tea, and coffee, and rich and unhealthful food preparations, . . . God demands that the appetite be cleansed, and that self-denial be practiced. . . . This is a work that will have to be done before His people can stand before Him a perfected people.‖ mclxxxviii24 Adventist leaders such as J. H. Waggoner saw the distinctive difference between contemporary voices appealing for health reform and the ―advanced principle‖ of Ellen White. Waggoner wrote: ―We do not profess to be pioneers in the general principles of the health reform. The facts on which this movement is based have been elaborated, in a great measure, by reformers, physicians, and writers on physiology and hygiene, and so may be found scattered through the land. But we do claim that by the method of God‘s choice it has been more clearly and powerfully unfolded, and is thereby producing an effect which we could not have looked for from any other means. ―As mere physiological and hygienic truths, they might be studied by some at their leisure, and by others laid aside as of little consequence; but when placed on a level with the great truths of the third angel‘s message by the sanction and authority of God‘s Spirit, and so declared to be the means whereby a weak people may be made strong to overcome, and our diseased bodies cleansed and fitted for translation, then it comes to us as an essential part of present truth, to be received with the blessing of God, or rejected at our peril.‖ mclxxxix25 Health directly affects moral judgment. Probably Ellen White‘s linking health with moral judgment has been one of the most compelling concepts for unnumbered thousands: ―Anything that lessens physical strength enfeebles the mind, and makes it less capable of discriminating between right and wrong. We become less capable of choosing the good and have less strength of will to do that which we know to be right.‖ mcxc26 Many early Adventists conceded that eliminating pork and alcoholic beverages was in one‘s best interest. Some further conceded that flesh foods were not beneficial. But the connection between temperance (self-control) and spiritual discernment, did not come quickly. Most, at first, saw no link between preaching the gospel or their own spiritual growth and what they ate. Ellen White maintained her course, often against many who thought she was advocating extremes. She resolutely led her colleagues into thinking more clearly: ―Some have sneered at this work of reform, and have said it was all unnecessary; that it was an excitement to divert minds from present truth. They have said that matters were being carried to extremes. Such do not know what they are talking about. While men and women professing godliness are diseased from the crown of their head to the soles of their feet, while their physical, mental, and moral energies are enfeebled through gratification of depraved appetite and excessive labor, how can they weigh the evidences of truth, and comprehend the requirements of God?‖ mcxci27 Commitment to health reveals one‘s depth of caring for others. Ellen White was intensely practical. Her counsel was easy to understand. In those days before the services of the modern hospital and the latest antibiotics, the extended family often lived under one roof. The elderly and the sick were the burdens of whoever happened to be healthy at the moment.
294
Mrs. White, observing how heavy that burden fell on young busy mothers and other members of the family, wrote: ―Many by their actions have said, ‗It is nobody‘s business whether I eat this or that. Whatever we do, we are to bear the consequences ourselves.‘ Dear friends, you are greatly mistaken. You are not the only sufferers from a wrong course. The society you are in bears the consequences of your wrongs, in a great degree, as well as yourselves. If you suffer from your intemperance in eating or drinking, we that are around you or associated with you are also affected by your infirmities. We have to suffer on account of your wrong course. . . . If, instead of having a
buoyancy of spirit, you are gloomy, you cast a shadow upon the spirits of all around you. . . . We may have a good degree of confidence in our own judgment, yet we want to have counselors; for ‗in the multitude of counselors there is safety‘. . . . But what care we for your judgment, if your brain nerve power has been taxed to the utmost, and the vitality withdrawn from the brain to take care of the improper food placed in your stomachs, or of an enormous quantity of even healthful food? . . . Therefore your course of living affects us. It is impossible for you to pursue any wrong course without causing others to suffer.‖ mcxcii28 Commitment to health is best motivated by a desire to glorify God in helping others. Paul made it clear that living for the glory of God is the Christian‘s highest goal: ―Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God‖ (1 Cor. 10:31). Ellen White frequently focused on this motivation as the ―glory of self-sacrificing love. In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that the love which ‗seeketh not her own‘ has its source in the heart of God.‖ mcxciii29 Side benefits of this highest motivation include longer life and less disease, etc. But if the higher motivation is eclipsed, much of health reform may be self-centered to the neglect of the well-being of others. Caring for one‘s health is a spiritual matter, not merely a physical concern. Commitment to health among the factors relating to a prepared people. Ellen White directly linked a person‘s commitment to physical and spiritual health with his or her readiness for eternal life. Here again ―restoration‖ mcxciv30—the goal of The Great Controversy Theme—determined the philosophy of health. Regarding the kind of people prepared for Jesus‘ return, Mrs. White wrote: ―We believe without a doubt that Christ is soon coming. . . . When He comes He is not to cleanse us of our sins, to remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us of the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for us at all, this work will all be accomplished before that time. When the Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. Those who have preserved their bodies and spirits in holiness, in sanctification and honor, will then receive the finishing touch of immortality.‖ mcxcv31 Not Merely a Difference of Opinion Uniting or separating the physical from the spiritual is not merely a philosophical issue, nor a matter of only interpersonal differences of opinion. The Kellogg crisis of the late 1890s and early 1900s may have ended up as a power struggle but it rested on issues far deeper than personal opinion. It centered on the future direction of Adventist thought and practice. At the turn of the century the denomination was struggling with the growing strength of the ―right arm.‖ mcxcvi32 The health-message proponents and its growing political (denominational) power seemed to be directing the worldwide program of the church. mcxcvii33 Complicating the confrontation were the aberrant theological views of Dr. Kellogg. At stake was not only the clarity of Adventist theology but also the direction of denominational finances. Underlying the power struggle was the
295 conviction of the medical leadership, with considerable evidence, that the ministerial leadership accepted only a part of the health message. Some denominational leaders actually resented Kellogg‘s enthusiastic endorsement of Mrs. White‘s larger view of healthful living—especially in her condemnation of flesh foods. Kellogg found it difficult to accept criticism of his book, The Living Temple, from meat-eating denominational leaders. mcxcviii34 Though wrong, from Kellogg‘s point of view Ellen White‘s support of the denomination‘s ―spiritual‖ leadership in 1901 (in the reorganization that would also limit the health arm) and in her attack on The Living Temple meant that she had been misled and strongly influenced by his enemies. The subsequent rupture between the health emphasis and the ministerial-theological leadership has separated many through the years and unnecessarily complicated the unified voice of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
The administrative ―surgery‖ in the 1900s that reduced the ―right arm‖ to its proper relationship to the body only deepened the wound. Divorcing the spiritual from the physical created an even more serious illness. Reducing the ―right arm‘s‖ political power to its proper relationship to denominational organization crippled the deeper issues of how physical habits directly affect mental and spiritual health. Some say that the ―right arm‖ of the gospel of health has been living in virtual isolation from the spiritual body—a sign that the spiritual body has misunderstood its own gospel. For some strange reason, for the most part, neither spiritual leaders nor health leaders saw that physical habits could not be separated from spiritual growth if the integrity of the Adventist message was to be maintained. Ellen White called this separation between gospel ministers and medical missionary workers ―the worst evil‖ that could be placed on the Adventist Church. mcxcix35 This rupture is not a mere theoretical disagreement. Not including the principles of the health message within the fullness of the ―everlasting gospel‖ directly affects the preparation of the church to fulfill its gospel commission. Further, it hinders growth in grace. mcc36 This divorce between what God Himself had joined together has limited the potential of the Adventist witness and blunted the full impact of the ―everlasting gospel.‖ (1) Denominational healthcare institutions may not fully sense their original purpose of (a) instructing the world in the application of ―natural remedial agencies‖ to prevent as well as cure disease and (b) to make their institutions an unequivocal witness to the principles of the gospel as developed in the third angel‘s message. mcci37 (2) At the same time, some spiritual leaders have either discredited or ignored the health principles that Dr. Kellogg and Ellen White strongly endorsed. Trying to promote the distinctive message of Revelation 14 with the right arm paralyzed is virtually self-defeating. Both medical and ministerial leadership have often forgotten that one of the principles of the Great Controversy Theme is that men and women are responsible and that God will not work ―miracles‖ that bypass obedience to known duty. mccii38 When both health leaders and spiritual leaders encourage ―healing‖ methods that bypass human responsibility for choices, the principles of life are violated. For example, when the sick are encouraged to receive health care without adherence to the natural laws that caused the sickness, the gospel is not understood. mcciii39 Or, when the sinner is encouraged to believe that God forgives when commitment to known duty is ignored, clearly the gospel is misrepresented. mcciv40 Ellen White boldly encouraged church members who sense ―the dead level into which they have fallen‖ to reconnect the health message to the theological message: ―Send into the churches workers who will set the principles of health reform in their connection with the third
296 angel‘s message before every family and individual. Encourage all to take a part in work for their fellow men, and see if the breath of life will not quickly return to these churches.‖ mccv41 Linkage of the Minister and the Physician The Great Controversy Theme seeks ―restoration‖ as the goal of salvation. Whatever subject Ellen White focuses on, this goal integrates all of its aspects. Thus the Great Controversy Theme informs the basis and purpose of health reform. It naturally follows, then, that the physician and the minister are to ―work in tandem. Like harnessed horses, they . . . [are] to pull the Adventist carriage at the same speed.‖ mccvi42 In the developing years of Adventist health work, Ellen White riveted her contemporaries on the importance of joining health reform with the completion of the gospel commission. mccvii43 For her, the gospel evangelist/minister and the gospel healer were to work together with mutual aims and joint evangelistic efforts. mccviii44 Dr. John Harvey Kellogg was one of the few leaders who took Mrs. White‘s counsel on health seriously. Few gospel ministers saw the same connection between the health message and spiritual development. mccix45 And her support of Dr. Kellogg was never in doubt, until—until Dr. Kellogg‘s fertile mind began to misunderstand the purpose of his own health message.
In 1896 he was instrumental in changing the name of his health network from the Seventh-day Adventist Medical Missionary and Benevolent Association to the International Medical Missionary and Benevolent Association. Two years later he explained that this organization was developed ―to carry forward medical and philanthropic work independent of any sectarian or denominational control, in home and foreign lands.‖ mccx46 In 1898 he declared at a convention of the association that the delegates gathered ―here as Christians, and not as Seventh-day Adventists.‘‖ mccxi47 Ellen White had been exceedingly patient with Dr. Kellogg, whom she and her husband had personally sponsored in getting his medical degree. mccxii48 She knew well the resentment and unpleasantries that some of the ministers had directed at him. And she knew also his untactful sharpness. But when he openly defied the denomination, which through the years had supplied the money for the development of his famous Battle Creek Sanitarium, she felt compelled to speak openly: ―It has been stated that the Battle Creek Sanitarium is not denominational. But if ever an institution was established to be denominational in every sense of the word, this sanitarium was.‖ mccxiii49 Dr. Kellogg was permitting health reform to eclipse theological principles. The situation came to a head, symbolized by the ―iceberg‖ analogy. mccxiv50 Though Ellen White groaned under the pending rupture between the ministers and the physicians, she was deeply sympathetic for her friend, Dr. Kellogg. In 1904 she wrote of her frustration and her empathy for him. But in that same letter she also wrote: ―My brethren, the Lord calls for unity, for oneness. We are to be one in the faith. I want to tell you that when the gospel ministers and the medical missionary workers are not united, there is placed on our churches the worst evil that can be placed there. . . . It is time that we stood upon a united platform. But we cannot unite with Dr. Kellogg until he stands where he can be a safe leader of the flock of God.‖ mccxv51 The challenge ever since 1904 has been to address ―the worst evil‖ that could rest on the Seventh-day Adventist Church. If the challenge is to be met, both ministers and physicians must restudy the counsel of Ellen White regarding the purpose of church healthcare institutions, rethink the purpose of the ―everlasting gospel‖ that must be proclaimed credibly before Jesus returns, and make a new commitment to the inspired principles set forth by Ellen White.
Chapter 26—Health Principles-Part 3: Quality Improvement in Adventist Health “You need not go into the water, or into the fire, but take the middle road, avoiding all extremes.” mccxvi1 Across the Adventist world in the 1860s went the broad message of health reform. Not all joined the march forward. But many did and their hearty gratitude was reported in the church paper. R. M. Kilgore, former army captain and longtime evangelist-administrator, described the new life of better health shared by many: ―As they advanced, they felt their diseases, aches, and pains leaving them, and in return buoyancy of spirit, and glow of health, the greatest earthly blessings. Thus, those in front accepted the offered mercies, not given by commandment or way of urging, but to obtain the blessing resulting from such a course of life and habits; by obeying the laws of their being which God implanted, and cleansing the temple for the indwelling of His Holy Spirit; which will be poured more copiously upon those who are ready to receive it.‖ mccxvii2 M. E. Cornell, pioneer evangelist in Michigan and California, penned his gratitude: ―I believe the reform came up just in time to save me from becoming a complete wreck. Fourteen years of incessant labor, with all kinds of unhealthy diet and but little attention to the laws of life, had nearly used up a strong constitution. Now I hope to recover, by the blessing of God, and endure to the end. My whole being cries out, Praise God for the health reform. Let those who have adopted the reform hold on. And I exhort all others to take hold of it in earnest.‖ mccxviii3
At 68, John Byington, the church‘s first General Conference president, wrote that after making ―proper changes in diet‖ he no longer had a severe cough that threatened his survival. Further, he
had ―gained in flesh, have more warmth in my system, and feel better prepared to endure another cold winter.‖ mccxix4 J. H. Waggoner affirmed: ―I thank God for the health reform. It is no cross; it is no hardship; it brings pleasure in pain and gives strength in weakness. . . . When bearing heavy burdens of body and mind, when all looked dark and cheerless in this world, it has come as a messenger of mercy, strengthening the body, cheering the mind, and refreshing the spirits, and bringing the peace of the Saviour to the sorrowing soul.‖ mccxx5 Joseph Clark, a layman, wrote enthusiastically: ―Since adopting the health reform, my own health has been so much benefited that I have been at a loss to know whether it was duty to tell others of it, lest they might consider me an enthusiast; but over two years have passed away since we commenced to live out the health reform, and it is proving to be even better than I had imagined at first.‖ mccxxi6 Looking back over the previous twenty years, Dr. J. H. Kellogg stated:
301 ―Numerous reforms in diet and dress were introduced and quite generally adopted. These reforms were of such a character that, when conscientiously carried out, they invariably produced a decided change for the better on the part of those adopting them. Hundreds who had for years suffered from various chronic ailments were soon relieved of the distressing symptoms which had been endured so long. Many whose cases had been pronounced hopeless were restored to excellent health. Others who seemed to be just on the brink of the grave received a new lease of life and ability for eminent usefulness. The most extraordinary evidences of good resulting from the adoption of health reform principles—results which in many instances seemed little short of miracles—were to be met on every hand. In every community of Sabbath-keepers were to be found those who freely acknowledged that they owed their lives to the light which they had received upon this question.‖ mccxxii7 James White, the Highly Visible Exception As we noted earlier, pages 54-56, James White since 1844 had been doing the work of several men. By the time he was 44 he was worn out. He had carried the burden of financial accountability when others were slow to contribute; he had almost single-handedly led a ―scattered flock‖ into becoming an organized church with doctrinal unity and a common goal; his pen had become a remarkable expositor of clear gospel teachings; and he was a constant source of encouragement and vision for others. But he did not know how to rest, nor was he temperate in his eating habits. On August 16, 1865, he suffered his first stroke after a week of unusual stress and little sleep. He was mentally and physically exhausted, virtually incapacitated. Realizing that emergency procedures were needed when he failed to respond to home rest, Ellen White remembered that her health reform principles included a special emphasis on hydrotherapy. But she did not know how this principle would work out in practice, especially for such a serious problem as her husband‘s. So, in late September, 1865, she took James to ―Our Home,‖ a health institution at Dansville, New York, that emphasized hydropathic treatments and other medical practices that involved natural methods rather than conventional drug therapy. mccxxiii8 In reflecting on this decision, especially when some church members thought they were not truly trusting James to God in prayer, Ellen White wrote: ―While we did not feel like despising the means God had placed in our reach for the recovery of health, we felt that God was above all, and He who had provided water as His agent would have us use it to assist abused Nature to recover her exhausted energies. We believed that God would bless the efforts we were making in the direction of health. ―We did not doubt that God could work a miracle, and in a moment restore to health and vigor. But should He do this, would we not be in danger of again transgressing—abusing our strength by prolonged, intemperate labor, and bringing upon ourselves even a worse condition of things?‖ mccxxiv9 The Gospel Sieve
The Whites remained at Dansville for three months although Dr. Jackson strongly advocated six to eight months. mccxxv10 What did they learn? By late November, Ellen White, convinced that James was not getting better, decided to return to their Battle Creek home. However, she ―did not feel that the three months . . . was in vain.‖ They had gathered ―many things of value from those who had obtained an experience in health reform.‖ But she concluded that there was no further ―necessity of gathering the chaff with the wheat.‖ mccxxvi11 Here, in a practical setting, her vision-driven understanding
302 of health reform was able to separate worthy principles of her day from the ill-advised. For example: Discarding salt at Dansville was not in everyone‘s best interest. Because of an emerging digestive problem, Dr. Jackson suggested that Ellen White eat in her room where she could use salt in moderation without raising questions in the minds of others. mccxxvii12 Overheated lecture halls seriously affected James‘s head. Fresh air was needed at all times for clear thinking as well as for physical comfort. mccxxviii13 Though they considered Dr. Jackson to be a ―clear and impressive speaker‖ and ―decidedly thorough,‖ mccxxix14 he and the other physicians believed that the Whites were ―too intensely religious, and that is the reason why we are invalids.‖ mccxxx15 The Dansville program emphasized ―amusements and pleasure, dancing, card-playing, theater going, etc.,‖ which the Whites could not harmonize with the ―teachings of Christ recorded in the New Testament.‖ mccxxxi16 While experiencing severe mood swings and sinking hope, many prayer sessions through the days and nights provided James with the peace of mind that led to sleep. Believing that overwork caused James‘s physical and mental breakdown, the Dansville physicians strongly promoted complete physical and mental inaction. But Ellen White realized that this dictum was ―one of the most serious obstacles to his recovery. Because of her vision-driven insights, she knew that for him ―to sink down in aimless inactivity was to foster disease and to become the prey of despondency.‖ mccxxxii17 Though she often stated that the Dansville ―water-cure establishment‖ was the best institution of its kind in the United States, she soon saw that those accompanying her and James would have to ―carry along with them at all times the gospel sieve, and sift everything they hear, that they may choose the good and refuse the bad.‖ mccxxxiii18 Early in December, Mrs. White was convinced that further time at Dansville would not help James recover. She saw his courage and buoyancy of spirit slipping rapidly. Weeks of inaction had brought him to the place where he himself feared physical exercise. Furthermore, she knew that trust in God was the pathway to courage and hope and that Dansville was not the environment to encourage such faith. And so to Rochester, New York, forty miles (64 km) from Dansville, the White party went where they would be surrounded by men and women of faith. The Rochester Vision of Hope and New Territory to Conquer While in family worship Christmas day, December 25, 1865, Ellen White was taken off in vision. This vision ranks with the Otsego vision of June 6, 1863, in unfolding the significance of health reform within the third angel‘s message. The Otsego vision opened up the integrated system of health principles that the Lord wanted the Adventist Church to adopt. The Rochester vision emphasized how feeble had been the response of most church members and gave even more explicit information as to how the church was to coordinate health reform with the gospel message. Ellen White wrote out the vision the next day and gave the document to James. For months they had been wondering why they had seen no progress in his recovery. They now knew why and what they must do about it.
The key points of the vision were: It was God‘s will that they went to Dansville, for otherwise they could not have learned what had to be known ―in so short a time.‖ The Dansville home is the ―best health institution in the United States . . . yet, the leaders there are but men, and their judgment is not always correct.‖ When people who have suffered much ―are relieved by an intelligent system of treatment . . . they are often led to
303 conclude‖ that their physicians who treat them are also ―right in matters of religious faith, or at least cannot greatly err from the truth.‖ God could not glorify His name by answering the prayers of His people for the Whites while at Dansville, for ―the physicians there would have taken the glory which should be given to God.‖ Through this experience God was ―fitting up‖ James to be a stronger leader in health reform, in that he and others could speak more effectively regarding the ―relation which eating, working, resting, and dressing sustain to health.‖ ―God requires all . . . to place themselves in the best possible condition of bodily health‖ to attain a ―healthy religious experience,‖ and that the Lord will not ―do for them that which He requires them to do for themselves.‖ James had let fear and anxiety overwhelm his faith and that, by the power of his will and trusting in God‘s power, he would regain his health. Church members had been ―negligent in acting upon the light which God has given in regard to the health reform‖: that such work ―had scarcely‖ begun. ―Few . . . understand how much their habits of diet have to do with their health, their characters, their usefulness in this world, and their eternal destiny.‖ ―God‘s people are not prepared for the loud cry of the third angel. They have a work to do for themselves which they should not leave for God to do for them.‖ Seventh-day Adventists must develop their own health institution. This institution would be ―the means of introducing our faith in new places and raising the standard of truth where it would have been impossible to gain access had not prejudice been first removed.‖ This health institution should provide a home for (1) ―the afflicted,‖ and (2) for those ―who wish to learn how to take care of their bodies that they may prevent sickness.‖ This institution must be financially independent, not to be ―embarrassed by a constant expenditure of means without realizing any returns.‖ ―The great object‖ of this institution ―is not only health, but perfection and the spirit of holiness, which cannot be attained with diseased bodies and minds.‖ The sick are to be taught that ―it is wrong to suspend all physical labor in order to regain health.‖ ―The greatest danger‖ would be for the managers to depart ―from the spirit of the present truth, and from that simplicity which should ever characterize the disciples of Christ . . . in order to help the feelings of unbelievers, and thus secure their patronage.‖ mccxxxiv19 The Beginning of Adventist Health Institutions The implications of this Rochester vision were broad; the principles set forth are still valid. In practice, this vision provided Ellen White with a course of action to help her feeble husband in his slow recovery, a plan to spend the winter of 1866-1867 in northern Michigan. mccxxxv20 Further, this vision became an electrifying call to the young church to advance and establish an Adventist health institution. On one hand, such a thought seemed preposterous; on the other, it was the next logical step in fulfilling God‘s plan through the Adventist Church.
Ellen White‘s Sabbath sermon at the General Conference session in Battle Creek, May 19, 1866, emphasized, perhaps for the first time publicly, the instruction given her in the Rochester health
reform vision. Within days, the leadership responded to the call for a health institution, though with trepidation. J. N. Loughborough, president of the Michigan Conference, recalled: ―When this testimony was read to our people, the question arose, ‗How can we, in our condition of limited means, obtain and control a health institution? . . . The committee . . . prayed over the matter, and said, ‗We will pledge to the enterprise,
304 venturing out on what is said in the testimony, though it looks to us like a heavy load for us to hold up.‘‖ mccxxxvi21 Within days, property was bought and tanks installed on the roof for hydrotherapy treatments. By September 5 the Western Health Reform Institute was ready for patients under the medical care of Drs. H. S. Lay and Phoebe Lamson. mccxxxvii22 Yet, many were the perils that lay ahead. The counsel of Ellen White saved the institutional management from making serious errors, especially in regard to the purpose of the institution: (1) The object is not primarily for ―gain,‖ although it must be financially independent, not drawing on other denominational funds; (2) Standards must not be lowered in order to ―patronize unbelievers‖: (3) The institution, though not to be a place for ―diversion or amusement,‖ will create an environment free from ―diseased imaginations,‖ ―dissatisfied feelings,‖ and ―discontented repinings‖: (4) The institution is established to ―improve the health of the body that the afflicted may more highly appreciate eternal things‖: (5) The institution should not expand any faster than adequate ―skill, experience, and finance could be provided.‖ mccxxxviii23 Even more amazing, in addition to establishing a medical institution, was the decision to publish Health Reformer, a periodical that Dr. H. S. Lay would edit. Shortly after its introduction, Ellen White wrote: ―The Health Reformer is the medium through which rays of light are to shine upon the people. It should be the best health journal in our country. It must be adapted to the wants of the common people, ready to answer all proper questions and fully explain the first principles of the laws of life and how to obey them and preserve health.‖ mccxxxix24 Fifth Health Vision The fifth of the health vision series occurred in Bordoville, Vermont, on December 10, 1871. mccxl25 Visions were not given frivolously or merely to repeat the message of previous visions. God dispenses wisdom as fast as men and women can appreciate it, especially after they have obeyed known duty. Prophets also learn step by step, even as church groups advance step by step in joining divine instruction with practice. mccxli26 By 1871 the Western Health Reform Institute had been operating for five years. The leaders were working in untried territory and mistakes were made, even to the point of failure. Without the Whites, the Institute would have died under a load of debt and extremist policies. mccxlii27 In the Bordoville vision Ellen White again reiterated the primary purpose of Adventist health institutions—a purpose that had become fuzzy in the interim: Adventist health work is as ―closely connected with the third angel‘s message as the hand is with the body.‖ mccxliii28 Further, Adventist health work was not to be done in some quiet corner: Adventist health principles should ―be agitated, and the public mind deeply stirred to investigate.‖ mccxliv29 Mrs. White reiterated that Adventist institutions are ―established upon different principles‖ from health centers that are ―conservative, making it their object to meet the popular class half way . . . that they will receive the greatest patronage and the most money.‖ mccxlv30 Other explicit principles relating to Adventist health institutions included: Adventist health institutions are to unite Biblical principles with the care of the sick. But Adventist distinctives ―should not be discussed with patients,‖ even in the weekly prayer meetings. ―Silent witness will do more than open controversy. . . . We must meet people where they are.‖ mccxlvi31 Wise health-care workers realize that many sufferers have more than physical pain. ―Many carry a violated conscience, and can be reached only by the principles of Bible religion.‖ mccxlvii32 The home church at Battle Creek must live up to its ―greatest responsibility,‖
305
and when church members do not live up to the light that health-care workers are giving to the patients, confusion and discouragement are the result. mccxlviii33 By the early 1870s Adventist interest in health reform, with its first medical institution and health journal plus its emphasis on training quality physicians, had now become highly visible and effective in reaching out to all classes of society. mccxlix34 The Principle of Moderation Avoids Extremes The credentials of a prophet are seen often in the common sense of his or her message. God is not unreasonable, neither are His prophets. Ellen White provides a classic example of common sense mccl35 in her relation to health reform. After she had emphasized the need for health reform through her writings for a few years, after the first few years of the Battle Creek health institution, and after a few years of the Health Reformer, she recognized that some caution was needed: ―In reforms, we would better come one step short of the mark than to go one step beyond it. And if there is error at all, let it be on the side next to the people.‖ mccli36 One of the problems that had developed in Battle Creek was the extremism fostered by Dr. Russell T. Trall and advocated by William Gage, resident editor of the Health Reformer. Dr. Trall advocated absolute discontinuance of salt, sugar, milk, butter, and eggs. This extremism caused confusion and a loss of subscriptions. When Ellen White returned from her west-coast camp meeting assignments, she saw why the Health Reformer was about dead: ―The position to entirely discontinue the use of these things [salt, sugar, milk, butter, and eggs] may be right in its order; but the time had not come to take a general stand upon these points.‖ mcclii37 Worse! The editor of the Health Reformer was ill. Why? Because he and those who were supporting these extreme positions for that time were not following a balanced program in their own homes! The confusion and subsequent despair among church members in their attempts to meet these extreme positions opened the door to much backsliding in the whole area of health reform. So Ellen White set forth several points for her fellow church members to consider: Meet people ―where they are.‖ mccliii38 Allow others ―as much time as we have required‖ to reach our present understanding. We must not ―advocate positions‖ that are not put to ―a practical test‖ in our own homes. ―A free use‖ of items such as salt, sugar, and milk is ―positively injurious to health‖ and ―if they were not used at all, a much better state of health would be enjoyed.‖ But, for the present, ―our burden is not upon these things [salt, sugar, milk, butter].‖ mccliv39 Because so many people were so far behind on health reform, they were advised to ―bear positive testimony against‖ the most ―injurious indulgences and stimulating narcotics . . . [such as] tobacco, spirituous liquors, snuff, tea, coffee, flesh meats, butter, spices, rich cakes, mince pies, a large amount of salt, and all exciting substances used as articles of food.‖ mcclv40 James Becomes Editor Because the editor of the Health Reformer was ill, and because the paper needed resuscitating, James White took over as editor. In his first editorial, he wrote: ―the Reformer proposes to reach the people with all their prejudices, and their ignorance of the laws of life, where they are. It will avoid extreme positions, and come as near those who need reforming as possible, and yet be true to the principles of health reform.‖ mcclvi41 Under his leadership, confidence was restored in the magazine and in the broad health principles that Ellen White advocated.
306 Within the first year, subscriptions increased from 3,000 to more than 10,000. mcclvii42
Every reform movement since New Testament times has had to contend with extremists. Their message may contain truth, but their timing, methods, and ensuing consequences do much to
weaken the impact of their message. At a New York conference in 1868 Ellen White wrote that some who were health reform advocates ―were extremists, and would run the health reform into the ground. . . . Their influence would disgust believers and unbelievers.‖ mcclviii43 Before pointing out some of the inconsistencies of these ―extremists,‖ Mrs. White insightfully analyzed typical reactions to a health reform message: ―The masses will reject any theory, however reasonable it may be, if it lays a restriction upon the appetite. The taste is consulted instead of reason and health. All who leave the common track of custom, and advocate reform, will be opposed, accounted mad, insane, radical, . . . [even if they] pursue ever so consistent a course.‖ mcclix44 Then she spoke plainly to several of these extremist spokesmen. One man, ―aided by items gathered from books,‖ had demanded that his family come up immediately to his ―high‖ standards, but in so doing he ―failed to bring himself to the mark, and to keep his body under.‖ His marital relations were more like the unleashing of ―animal propensities‖ than those of a considerate husband. His wife was not in a condition to give birth ―to healthy children.‖ Why? Because ―he did not provide the quality and quantity of food that was necessary to nourish two lives instead of one.‖ Her children were born with ―feeble digestive powers and impoverished blood.‖ Applying Common Sense Note how Ellen White applied her principle of common sense and moderation: ―Her system craved material to convert into blood; but he would not provide it. A moderate amount of milk and sugar, a little salt, white bread raised with yeast for a change, graham flour prepared in a variety of ways by other hands than her own, plain cake with raisins, occasionally, and many other dishes I might mention, would have answered the demand of appetite. If he could not obtain some of these things, a little domestic wine [for medicinal purposes] would have done her no injury; it would have been better for her to have it than to do without it. In some cases, even a small amount of the least hurtful meat would do less injury than to suffer strong cravings for it.‖ mcclx45 She then turned to another family who had lost a loved one because of a physician guilty of ―maltreatment‖ under the guise of health reform. Apparently a young man had died after a severe fever. After recognizing that ―abstinence from food for a short time will lessen the fever,‖ she noted that when the fever is broken, ―nourishment should be given in a careful, judicious manner.‖ However, each person should be treated on an individual basis. ―If there is a great desire expressed for food, even during the fever, to gratify that desire with a moderate amount of simple food would be less injurious than for the patient to be denied.‖ mcclxi46 In the case of this young man, Ellen White specifically pointed to mismanagement that led to his unnecessary death: ―A little good wine and food would have brought him back to his family.‖ The father also would have died if it had not been for the ―presence and timely counsel of a doctor from the Health Institute.‖ Doing the best possible under the circumstances was a basic health principle with Ellen White. mcclxii47 She warned concerning extremists: ―It is impossible for the best qualified advocates of health reform to fully relieve the minds of the public from the prejudice received through the wrong course of these extremists, and to place the great
307 subject of health reform upon a right basis in the community where these men have figured. The door is also closed in a great measure, so that unbelievers cannot be reached by the present truth upon the Sabbath and the soon coming of our Saviour.‖ mcclxiii48 In 1868 James White wrote an editorial pointing out that extremists made the work of Mrs. White unnecessarily difficult: ―While Satan tempts the many to be too slow, he always tempts these [some with more zeal than caution] to be too fast. Mrs. W.‘s labors are made very hard, and, sometimes perplexing, by reason of the course of extremists, who think the only safe position is to take the extreme view of every expression she has written or spoken upon points where different views may be taken.‖ mcclxiv49
Both James and Ellen White recognized individual differences. mcclxv50 They were patient with others because they knew how long it had taken them to see the logic and beauty in health principles that were affirmed by vision. mcclxvi51 They further knew that they could not be conscience for anyone else. They could lead only by example and clear teaching.
Chapter 27—Health Principles-Part 4: Principles and Policies “Let it ever be kept before the mind that the great object of hygienic reform is to secure the highest possible development of mind and soul and body. All the laws of nature—which are the laws of God—are designed for our good. Obedience to them will promote our happiness in this life, and will aid us in a preparation for the life to come.” mcclxvii1 Ellen White set forth certain guidelines that would help everyone to make positive and progressive decisions, especially in health reform. The first principle, which applies to all areas of Christian responsibilities, is that everyone knows for himself what ―known duty‖ is. ―Known duty‖ at any given moment may not be the same for any two people. Yet, to balk at ―known duty,‖ little or much, reveals the heart of a rebel—a deeper problem than a matter of diet. mcclxviii2 In 1893 Ellen White wrote: ―No one can believe with the heart unto righteousness, and obtain justification by faith, while continuing the practice of those things which the Word of God forbids, or while neglecting any known duty.‖ mcclxix3 Neglecting ―known duty‖ will cause ―weakness and darkness, and subject us to fierce temptation.‖ mcclxx4 In other words, to hear instruction that God validated through Ellen White but not to incorporate it into one‘s life, opens the door to other temptations and spiritual darkness. The second principle is that we should do the best we can under all circumstances. For example, in the days when nutritional supplements were not available, or when various vegetables and fruit were not easily obtainable, Ellen White suggested that grape juice in the best form available was appropriate as a food supplement for medicinal purposes. mcclxxi5 Obviously she was not suggesting that wine be used as a recreational beverage or as a feature of one‘s regular diet. When she advised ―domestic wine‖ for medicinal purposes, she knew that the sick person needed the nutritional properties of the grape, nutrients that could be assimilated quickly by the body. Under the circumstances, if the domestic wine contained a little alcohol, it still would have provided more benefit than not taking it. In 1868, in one of his question/ answer articles, James White wrote: ―During the past year, Mrs. W. has, at three or four times, had feelings of great debility and faintness in the morning. . . . To prevent distressing faintness at these times, she, immediately after rising, had taken an egg in a little pure, domestic, grape wine, perhaps a spoonful at a time, and never thought that this had to do with drugs, as she uses the term in her writings, more than with the man in the moon. During the past year, she may have used one pint of wine. It is only in extreme cases that the use of wine is justifiable, and then let it be a ‗little wine,‘ to gently stimulate those in a sinking condition.‖ mcclxxii6 In Australia during the 1890s, finding a quality diet was difficult and meat was the cheapest food available. On one occasion when sickness was in a neighbor‘s
311 home, Mrs. White recalled that ―there was nothing in the house suitable to eat. And they refused to eat anything that we took them. They had been accustomed to having meat. We felt that something must be done. I said to Sara [McEnterfer], ‗Take chickens from my place, and prepare them some broth.‘ . . . They soon recovered.‖ The lesson? ―Although we did not use flesh foods ourselves, when we thought it essential for that family in their time of sickness, we gave them what we felt they needed. There are occasions when we must meet the people where they are.‖ mcclxxiii7 Here again, however, common sense is needed: the first and second principle taken together should give wisdom to the health-care provider and to the ill.
The third principle is to avoid ―everything hurtful,‖ and the fourth principle is ―to use judiciously that which is healthful.‖ mcclxxiv8 The fifth principle focuses on self-control. ―Excessive indulgence in eating, drinking, sleeping, or seeing is sin.‖ mcclxxv9 Self-indulgence is often displayed in ―dressing‖ and ―overwork,‖ thus indicating that the mind is not under the ―control of reason and conscience.‖ mcclxxvi10 The sixth principle is that we should ―not mark out any precise line to be followed in diet.‖ mcclxxvii11 Obviously, clear and precise warnings were given on certain unhealthful foods. But in turning to the diet that should take the place of injurious foods, Ellen White stroked out broad lines, such as ―grains, fruits, nuts and vegetables.‖ mcclxxviii12 Why the broad strokes without ―precise lines‖? Because she recognized that a healthful diet must recognize individual differences in climate, occupation, and physical characteristics. mcclxxix13 The seventh principle reveals caring and compassion: a non-flesh diet should not be urged until appropriate substitutes for protein are available and the reasons for the replacement understood. mcclxxx14 The eighth principle focuses on the motivation behind health reform: health reform is not a set of duties by which we impress God and earn His love (legalism). Rather, it is one more revelation from a loving Lord as to how best to avoid sorry circumstances that result from bad decisions. Health reform contains those insights that will hasten character development and a life of service—the object of redemption and the purpose of living. Health reform embodies a system of choices that is understood progressively through experience. For this reason, meat eating, for example, has never been a ―test of fellowship‖ in the Seventh-day Adventist Church. mcclxxxi15 The ninth principle is best expressed in Ellen White‘s simple formula: ―I make myself a criterion for no one else.‖ She did not attempt to be conscience for others; neither did she make ―a raid‖ on the tables of those who were slower to follow advancing light. mcclxxxii16 The tenth principle permeates the previous nine: We must reason from cause to effect, perhaps best expressed in Paul‘s counsel: ―God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap‖ (Gal. 6:7). mcclxxxiii17 Ellen White’s Journey, Step by Step Both James and Ellen White realized that it took time for them to respond ―step by step‖ to advancing truth. mcclxxxiv18 Experience, common sense, and divine insight prompted her often-repeated principle: ―The diet reform should be progressive.‖ mcclxxxv19 God has always used this principle in revealing truth. mcclxxxvi20 Visions in 1848 and 1854 emphasized the injurious effects of tobacco, coffee, and tea. In the second vision such health-related issues as lack of bodily cleanliness, and the need for appetite control were noted. mcclxxxvii21 Ellen White stated that in 1863 ―the Lord presented a general plan before me,‖ including the concept that caring for one‘s health is a spiritual duty. mcclxxxviii22 Six months later she wrote: ―Our plain food, eaten twice a day, is enjoyed with a keen relish. We have no meat, cake, or any rich food upon our table. We
312 use no lard, but in its place, milk, cream, and some butter. We have our food prepared with but little salt, and have dispensed with spices of all kinds. We breakfast at seven, and take our dinner at one. . . . My food is eaten with a greater relish than ever before.‖ mcclxxxix23 In 1870 Mrs. White revealed further how health principles were working in her home. She referred to her ―well-set table on all occasions.‖ Visitors, expected and unexpected, came frequently. Sheset before everybody ―simple, healthful food‖ and ―if any want more than this, they are at liberty to find it elsewhere. No butter or flesh meats of any kind come on my table. Cake is seldom there. I generally have an ample supply of fruits, good bread, and vegetables.‖ Sugar was not placed on the table although sometimes it was used in kitchen preparation. mccxc24 When traveling on the railroad in 1870 the Whites ate at their usual hour, 1:00 P.M., ―of graham bread without butter, and a generous supply of fruit.‖ mccxci25
The Best Food Available Did Ellen White eat meat after 1863? Yes, but not as a regular part of her diet. She practiced the general principles she taught others, such as that one must use the best food available under the circumstances. When away from home, either while traveling or camping in austere conditions, decades before frozen foods were invented, finding an adequate diet was often difficult. Not always able to obtain the best, for whatever reason, she at times settled for the good—the best under the circumstances. In 1873 while on a working vacation high in the Rocky Mountains, the White party had no choice but to hunt and fish for food. She wrote in her diary: ―Our provisions have been very low for some days. Many of our supplies have gone. . . . We expected supplies three days ago certainly, but none have come. Willie went to the lake for water. We heard his gun and found he had shot two ducks. This is really a blessing, for we need something to live upon.‖ mccxcii26 A few weeks later, after arriving in California, she reported that they no longer ate meat, although they ―bought meat once for May Walling while she was sick, but not a penny have we expended for meat since.‖ mccxciii27 During the rainy, foggy January of 1884, Ellen White spent some time at the St. Helena Health Retreat where there was more sunshine and warmth. But the physician, manager, and cook did not favor a vegetarian cuisine. She wrote of her experience: ―When I came to the Retreat, I determined not to taste meat, but I could get scarcely anything else to eat, and therefore ate a little meat. It caused unnatural action of the heart. It was not the right kind of food. . . . ―The use of meat while at the Retreat awakened the old appetite, and after I returned home, it clamored for indulgence. Then I resolved to change entirely, and not under any circumstances eat meat, and thus encourage this appetite. Not a morsel of meat or butter has been on my table since I returned. We have milk, fruit, grains, and vegetables. ―For a time I lost all desire for food. Like the children of Israel, I hankered after flesh meats. But I firmly refused to have meat bought or cooked. I was weak and trembling, as everyone who subsists on meat will be when deprived of the stimulus. But now my appetite has returned. I enjoy bread and fruit, my head is generally clear, and my strength firmer. I have none of the goneness so common with meat eaters. I have had my lesson, and, I hope, learned it well.‖ mccxciv28 In 1888 Mrs. White wrote that she had not bought ―a penny‘s worth of tea for years.‖ However, she would use some tea ―as a medicine‖ for ―severe vomiting.‖ mccxcv29 In 1890, after two years of traveling in Europe, she observed: ―Where plenty of good milk and fruit can be obtained there is rarely any excuse for eating animal food. . . . In certain cases of illness or
313 exhaustion it may be thought best to use some meat, but great care should be taken to secure the flesh of healthy animals. . . . When I could not obtain the food I needed, I have sometimes eaten a little meat; but I am becoming more and more afraid of it.‖ mccxcvi30 Ellen White, with her heavy writing program and frequent public appearances, needed the help of a cook to care for her extended family. She was not always able to secure the services of a cook trained in health reform principles. In Australia during the 1890s, where fruit, vegetables, grains, and nuts were not easy to obtain or affordable, meat was the standby for most people. Two weeks after arriving in Australia, she penned her plea: ―I am suffering more now for want of someone who is experienced in the cooking line, to prepare things I can eat. The cooking in this country is in every way deficient. Take out the meat, which we seldom use—and I dare not use it here at all—and sit at their tables, and if you can sustain your strength, you have an excellent constitution. . . . I would pay a higher price for a cook than for any other part of my work.‖ mccxcvii31
While in Australia, she came to the place where she ―absolutely banished meat from my table.‖ For a time, she had allowed some meat to be served to workers and family members. From that time on [January, 1894] it was understood ―that whether I am at home or abroad, nothing of this kind is to
be used in my family, or come upon my table. I have had much representation before my mind in the night season on this subject.‖ mccxcviii32 Ellen White’s Dietary Practice After 1900 What was her dietary practice at Elmshaven after her return to America in 1900? A number of letters reveal the daily routine of that busy home with many workers and members of the family eating together. Among the dietary features of the White home were: mccxcix33 Breakfast at 7:30 A.M. and dinner at 1:00 P.M., the most convenient time decided by the extended family; No meat, no butter, no cheese, no ―greasy mixtures of food‖: ―all are satisfied‖ with the cream from their two cows; Ellen White preferred vermicelli and canned tomatoes cooked together, which she ate with zwieback; stewed fruit of various kinds augmented her main meal. Other items used occasionally included dried corn cooked with milk, and lemon pie; All members of the extended family ate items that best served their needs. (Ellen White said that she did not hold herself up as a criterion for them); Anyone desiring to eat in the evening was free to do so; A variety of food—simple, wholesome, and palatable—was always provided. What shall we make of this ―step-by-step‖ journey? Ellen White‘s major health visions of 1863 and 1865 encompassed all features of the health reform message that she emphasized until her death. Changes in certain emphases through the years only refined those principles, they did not add or subtract from them. As time passes, even prophets must take time to assimilate revealed principles—time for theory to become practice in their own lives. She constantly advocated the principle, in practice as well as in teaching, that everyone who is committed to truth will move from the bad to the good, from the good to the better, from the better to the best. Such was her experience. Ellen White saw the difference between patently injurious substances (alcoholic beverages, pork, tobacco, tea, and coffee) and those items of diet that were not healthful in immoderate amounts (clean meat, milk, eggs, salt, and sugar). Some of this divine insight, especially regarding pork, came as a surprise to her. Other items were being discussed in the nineteenth century, but nowhere else were all the principles she advanced integrated
314 into a practical program. Nowhere else were these principles put in terms of preparing a people for the coming of the Lord. What may appear to be lapses in her journey from the good to the best (in incorporating into her life-practice divinely-revealed health principles), can well be understood by those who remember their own journey from the good to the best. Circumstances beyond one‘s control and the absence of the best often dictate selections that are not always one‘s preferred choice. Those who understand the gospel, those who realize that God asks only for our best under the circumstances that prevail, those who realize that obedience to known duty is not done to impress God (legalism) but to honor Him—such people will understand why on rare occasions and unusual circumstances Ellen White ate some meat. Ellen White followed the principle of the Great Controversy Theme that was reflected in Christ‘s example—truth should never be coerced. She conveyed to others, whenever she had an appropriate opportunity, the principles of health reform as she had received them—an integrated, coordinated system of principles that promises health of mind and body and soul. She was clear and forceful regarding the relationship of health to one‘s spiritual growth and eternal destiny. But she did not compel, threaten, or coerce others to do what she knew they should do—she would not be conscience or criterion for others. That fact, in itself, reveals the truth about God and our responsibility for each other. mccc34
We are now better able to understand what Ellen White meant when she said at the General Conference session of 1909: ―It is reported by some that I have not followed the principles of health reform as I have advocated them with my pen; but I can say that I have been a faithful health reformer. Those who have been members of my family know that this is true.‖ mccci35 In modern attempts to understand history, too frequently we judge the past by the present, most often unknowingly. Individuals of the past must be judged in the context of their circumstances, not ours. In a day without refrigeration, when obtaining fresh fruit and vegetables depended on where one lived and the time of the year, when meat substitutes were rarely obtainable before the introduction of peanut butter and dry-cereals (mid-1890s), mcccii36 on some occasions one either ate meat or nothing at all. In our day, at least in developed countries, meat eating is rarely a necessity. Rumors and Allegations What should we make of the rumors and charges that have been circulated through the years regarding Ellen White‘s own dietary choices? Ham on the White table. D. M. Canright, a hostile ex-Adventist preacher, is reported to have said that he saw the Whites eat ham in their own home. He probably was right since he ―embraced the Sabbath‖ under James White‘s preaching in 1859. Early Adventists did not understand the distinction between clean and unclean meats. In the late 1850s, the Whites were still eating swine‘s flesh. mccciii37 Not until after the Otsego vision of June, 1863, did they cease eating it. mccciv38 Between 1859 and 1863, Canright would have had many opportunities to see the Whites eating swine‘s flesh. Ellen White was a backslider on meat eating all her life. Ellen White did not claim that after the 1863 Otsego health vision she never again ate meat. Prior to the vision, she believed that she ―was dependent upon a meat diet for strength.‖ Because of her weak physical condition, especially for her tendency to faint when weak and dizzy, she thought that meat was ―indispensable.‖ mcccv39 In fact, at that time she was ―a great meat eater‖: flesh meat was her ―principal article of diet.‖ mcccvi40 But she complied with advancing light. She cut meat out of her ―bill of fare‖ immediately, along with butter and three
315 meals a day. What was the result? ―My former faint and dizzy feelings have left me.‖ Years later, at eighty-two years of age, she could write: ―I have better health today, notwithstanding my age, than I had in my younger days.‖ mcccvii41 Yet, as we studied earlier (see p. 312), Ellen White did eat meat occasionally, noting in 1901 that there were times in the past when she ―was compelled to eat a little meat.‖ mcccviii42 Difficult travel conditions, new cooks, and medical emergencies demanded reasonable adjustments. In other words, she was not a fanatic regarding meat eating, especially in her counsel to others: ―I have never felt that it was my duty to say that no one should taste of meat under any circumstances. To say this . . . would be carrying matters to extremes. I have never felt that it was my duty to make sweeping assertions. What I have said I have said under a sense of duty, but I have been guarded in my statements, because I did not want to give occasion for anyone to be conscience for another.‖ mcccix43 It is also important to note that Ellen White distinguished between ―meat‖ and ―fish.‖ In 1876 she wrote her traveling husband: ―We have not had a particle of meat in the house since you left and long before you left. We have had salmon a few times. It has been rather high [in price].‖ mcccx44 In poverty-stricken Australia during the mid-1890s, she recognized that fish would be an appropriate part of the diet of the workmen who were building Avondale College. In a letter to her son Willie, she wrote: ―We cannot feed them all, but will you please get us dried codfish and dried fish of any description—nothing canned? This will give a good relish to the food.‖ mcccxi45
Two years after her personal no-meat pledge at the Brighton (Australia) camp meeting, Mrs. White wrote to her non-Adventist niece, Mary Clough Watson: ―Two years ago I came to the conclusion that there was danger in using the flesh of dead animals, and since then I have not used meat at all. It is never placed on my table. I use fish when I can get it. We get beautiful fish from the salt water lake near here. I use neither tea nor coffee. As I labor against these things, I cannot but practice that
which I know to be best for my health, and my family are in perfect harmony with me. You see, my dear niece, that I am telling you matters just as they are.‖ mcccxii46 Oysters. Fannie Bolton, mcccxiii47 a former literary assistant, wrote that Ellen White, at a rail depot, ate ―big white raw oysters with vinegar, pepper and salt. . . . I was overwhelmed with this inconsistency and dumb with horror. Elder Starr hurried me out and made all sorts of excuses and justifications of Sister White‘s action; yet I kept thinking in my heart, ‗What does it mean? What has God said? How does she dare eat these abominations?‘‖ mcccxiv48 When G. B. Starr heard of this letter he was astounded. He responded to W. C. White: ―I can only say that I regard it as the most absurdly, untruthful lot of rubbish that I have ever seen or read regarding our dear Sister White. ―The event simply never occurred. I never saw your mother eat oysters or meat of any kind either in a restaurant or at her own table. Fannie Bolton‘s statement . . . is a lie of the first order. I never had such an experience and it is too absurd for anyone who ever knew your mother to believe. . . . ―I think this entire letter was written by Fannie Bolton in one of her most insane moments. . . . mcccxv49 ―When we visited Florida in 1928, Mrs. Starr and I were told that at a camp meeting, Fannie Bolton made a public statement that she had lied about Sister White, and that she repented of it.‖ mcccxvi50 Though Fannie Bolton‘s report was false, Ellen White did request oysters in 1882 in a letter to Mary, her daughter-in-law: ―If you can get me a good box of herrings, fresh ones, please do so. These last ones that Willie got are bitter and old.
316 If you can buy . . . half a dozen cans of good tomatoes, please do so. We shall need them. If you can get a few cans of good oysters, get them.‖ mcccxvii51 What shall we make of this request for oysters? Aren‘t oysters considered unclean according to Leviticus 11? The answer to that question was not clear to Seventh-day Adventists in the 1880s any more than their attitude toward pork was clear in the 1850s. mcccxviii52 In 1883 W. H. Littlejohn, pastor of the Battle Creek Tabernacle, conducted a question/answer column in the church paper. In answering whether oysters are included among the unclean foods of Leviticus 11, Littlejohn said: ―It is difficult to decide with certainty whether oysters would properly come under the prohibition of Leviticus 11:9-12. . . . It would, however, seem from the language, as if they might.‖ mcccxix53 Where no direct vision insight was given, Adventists like anybody else had to work their way through such dietary matters. Ellen White was a hypocrite. This charge is based on the fact that Ellen White was lucid and forthright regarding the danger of meat eating but occasionally ate flesh foods. Her son W. C., wrote to G. B. Starr in 1933 that the White family had been vegetarians but not always ―teetotalers‖ (total abstainers from flesh foods). In 1894, Ellen White wrote to a non-Adventist active in the temperance cause in Australia who had asked about the Adventist position on being ―total abstainers‖: ―I am happy to assure you that as a denomination we are in the fullest sense total abstainers from the use of spirituous liquors, wine, beer, [fermented] cider, and also tobacco and all other narcotics. . . . All are vegetarians, many abstaining from the use of flesh food, while others use it in only the most moderate degree.‖ mcccxx54 Many of Ellen White‘s strongest statements against meat were written after she had renewed her commitment to total abstinence in 1894. Here we note that for Ellen White a vegetarian was not necessarily a ―teetotaler,‖ that is, a total abstainer, but one who did not eat flesh foods as a habit. Here we have a clear example of the difference between a principle and a policy. Vegetarianism was a policy based upon principle: we should eat the best food obtainable under the circumstances. Principles are clear statements, always true under all circumstances. Policies may change, due to time, place, and circumstances. Policies work out the principles by always doing the best possible under the circumstances. Only the individual‘s conscience knows when those decisions of doing ―one‘s best‖ have been made.
Applying the Principles For Ellen White, the two basic principles in health reform are to ―preserve the best health,‖ mcccxxi55 and ―to eat the food which is most nourishing‖ in any given set of circumstances. mcccxxii56 In applying these principles, she said on many occasions: ―In countries where there are fruits, grains, and nuts in abundance, flesh food is not the right food for God‘s people.‖ mcccxxiii57 She frequently used the term, ―principle,‖ when stating her views on health reform. She credited her much improved personal health to ―the principles of health reform.‖ mcccxxiv58 She noted that her instruction on health reform dwelt ―upon general principles.‖ mcccxxv59 Toward the end of her life, reflecting back on the years since 1863, she penned: ―It is reported by some that I have not lived up to the principles of health reform, as I have advocated them with my pen. But I can say that so far as my knowledge goes, I have not departed from those principles.‖ mcccxxvi60 For this reason Ellen White counseled church members ―to avoid meat eating, not because it is regarded as a sin to eat meat, [that is, not a principle] but because it is not healthful [but a good policy].‖ mcccxxvii61
317 She understood clearly the difference between unchangeable principles and the conditionality of policies. Note this wisdom: ―Those who understand the laws of health and who are governed by principle, will shun the extremes, both of indulgence and of restrictions. Their diet is chosen, not for the mere gratification of appetite, but for the upbuilding of the body. They seek to preserve every power in the best condition for the highest service to God and man. . . . There is real common sense in dietetic reform. The subject should be studied broadly and deeply, and no one should criticize others because their practice is not, in all things, in harmony with his own. It is impossible [in matters of diet] to make an unvarying rule to regulate everyone‘s habits, and no one should think himself a criterion for all.‖ mcccxxviii62 Prior to the 1901 General Conference session, a few leaders met with Ellen White concerning dietary practices. Her remarks were recorded by C. C. Crisler, her secretary: ―Oh, how it has hurt me to have the [road] blocks thrown in the way in regard to this subject. Some have said, ‗Sister White eats cheese, and therefore we are at liberty to eat cheese.‘ I have tasted cheese once or twice, but that is a different thing from making it a diet. Once when at Minneapolis, I sat down at a table on which there was some cheese. I was quite sick at the time, and some of my brethren told me that they thought if I ate a little cheese, it might do me good. I ate a small piece, and from then it has been reported in large assemblies that Sister White eats cheese. ―I have not had meat in my house for years. But do not give up the use of meat because Sister White does not eat it. I would not give a farthing for your health reform if that is what it is based upon. I want you to stand in your individual dignity and in your individual consecration before God, the whole being dedicated to Him. . . . I want you to think of these things. Do not make any human being your criterion.‖ mcccxxix63 Ellen White understood clearly the difference between principle and policy. Her common sense in regard to health reform made her a physically stronger, more productive person as she became older—not a common experience for many in her day. Far from being a hypocrite, she led the way in assimilating principle into practice. Dietary practices were not a form of penance, nor a ritual by which to earn salvation. mcccxxx64
Chapter 28—Health Principles-Part 5: Reviewing a Century of Health Reform Principles
“The health and lifespan advantages of the Seventh-day Adventist Church have been traced to the way they live and eat. Since the 1800s, Seventh-day Adventists have practiced eight secrets of health that reduce their risk of heart disease and cancer . . . the two leading causes of premature death. By keeping these two killers at bay, Seventh-day Adventists enjoy greater health and a longer
life than the general population. . . . The scientific confirmation has just been available in recent years, so how did they know before the scientists? From a woman named Ellen G. White. This visionary said God did not want people to suffer unnecessary illness and death and He inspired her to tell people how they could enjoy maximum wellness. Ellen G. White wrote with amazing simplicity and accuracy what has since been proved to be the best formula for health and longevity.” mcccxxxi1 In reviewing Ellen White‘s health reform principles, readers should first place themselves in the middle of the nineteenth century. Without any more information about the future than the prevailing notions that governed medical practice at that time, think of how strange the unfolding, synthesizing, integrating health principles of Ellen White must have seemed. Of course, some of these principles had been promoted by contemporaries, but in no place were they so complete or so integrated. No other writers were so free from those errors that subsequent research contradicted. mcccxxxii2 For the average person, even for physicians, in the middle of the nineteenth-century, the germ theory was unheard of. Physicians were still using opium, calomel, mercury, arsenic, and strychnine to ―heal‖ disease. Aspirin was unknown, along with the X-ray machine, antibiotics, pasteurization, immunizations, and blood transfusions. People generally saw no connection between their life style and disease. Fresh air in the home, night or day, aroused qualms for fear of catching a cold or being bitten by an invasion of flies or mosquitoes. mcccxxxiii3 People seldom bathed. mcccxxxiv4 Headlines shouting the deteriorating impact of high-fat, low-fiber diets and the sheer necessity of exercise were a century away. mcccxxxv5 The profound linkage between the mind and body seemed far-fetched. Birth defects due to drugs and alcohol were not to be understood for another hundred years. The concept of cancer germs was a thought that was cross-grain with the medical world. Prenatal influences were considered of little importance. In many of these areas, as recently as a few decades ago, Ellen White seemed not only extreme but even fanatical. Imagine how she could have been viewed in 1863! The record is in, however. Those who believed in her role as God‘s messenger, those who faithfully put her health principles into practice, became healthier, stronger, more productive people. To the extent that people picked and chose which principles they would incorporate into their life style, to that extent they fell short of reaching their full potential. Dietary Aspects of Health Reform Has anyone ever become sick or sicker by following these health principles? Have the health reform principles advocated by Ellen White proved to be unfounded or dangerous? Yeast germ in bread. Ellen White
321 penned that bread should be ―thoroughly baked that, so far as possible, the yeast germs shall be destroyed.‖ She was scoffed at for this statement, even as late as the 1940s. For years popular magazines advocated eating a cake of live yeast daily! We now know that live yeast cells ―take up B vitamins from the food material in the intestine, thus making them unavailable for the body.‖ mcccxxxvi6 Butter. In 1870 Ellen White wrote that ―from principle‖ she had discarded the use of meat, butter, mince pies, spices, and lard. mcccxxxvii7 In 1903 she stated that ―as for myself, I have settled the butter question. I do not use it.‖ mcccxxxviii8 Health principles, for Ellen White, guided one‘s plan of life in determining what the best choice should be under all circumstances. At times, in the absence of the best, we must settle for the good. Here again we see her principle of ―progressive‖ diet reform: ―Let the people be taught how to prepare food without the use of milk or butter.‖ mcccxxxix9 Further suggestions included: ―Butter is less harmful when eaten on cold bread than when used in cooking.‖ mcccxl10 ―When properly prepared, olives, like nuts, supply the place of butter and flesh meats.‖ mcccxli11 What‘s bad about butter? Two basic problems: disease and health factors relating to fat and cholesterol in the diet. Regarding disease, in the late 1800s butter ―was often rancid . . . a mixture of casein and water, or of calcium, gypsum, gelatin fat [sic] and mashed potatoes.‖ mcccxlii12
Referring to the future, Ellen White wrote: ―Tell them that the time will soon come when there will be no safety in using eggs, milk, cream, or butter, because disease in animals is increasing.‖ mcccxliii13 Apart from the danger of disease, butter is almost pure fat. It has many of the long-chained saturated fatty acids that tend to increase serum cholesterol (as well as short-chained fatty acids which do not cause the problem). One tablespoon of butter contains 33 mg. of saturated fats and cholesterol. The American Heart Association stated on May 13, 1994: ―Because butter is rich in both saturated fat and cholesterol, it is potentially a highly atherogenic food [causing hardening of the arteries]. Most margarine is made from vegetable fat and provides no dietary cholesterol. The more liquid the margarine, i.e., tub or liquid forms, the less hydrogenated it is and the less trans fatty acids it contains. Therefore, though still high in fat, margarine is a preferable substitute for butter, and soft margarines are better than hard ones.‖ mcccxliv14 Dietary fiber. Ellen White warned that ―fine-flour bread cannot impart to the system the nourishment that you will find in the unbolted-wheat bread. The common use of bolted-wheat bread cannot keep the system in a healthy condition.‖ mcccxlv15 The body needs two major types of fiber in the diet. Soluble fiber helps to lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The best sources are oats, beans, apples, barley, and buckwheat: thus these foods help reduce the risk of a heart attack. Insoluble fiber can be found in wheat bran, which reduces the risk of colon cancer. Foods high in fiber help to reduce the risk of carcinogenic agents in the intestines. The fiber attaches to the cholesterol and bile acids that have been secreted by the gallbladder, and removes them from the intestinal tract rapidly. Animal products have little or no fiber. Refined grains and other refined products have very little. In an Adventist Health Study, mcccxlvi16 men who often ate whole wheat bread had only 56 percent of the expected non-fatal heart attack rate and 89 percent of the expected fatal heart attack rate. Numerous recent studies relate the risk of colon cancer to the lack of fiber in the diet. Gastrointestinal transit time is seventy-seven hours when on a refined diet, but thirty-five hours on an unrefined diet. mcccxlvii17 Populations on a refined diet have a higher incidence of colon cancer than in countries where most are on an unrefined diet. mcccxlviii18 Colon-cancer risk decreases as the
322 fiber in the diet increases. Experts such as Dr. D. P. Burkitt, world-renowned British surgeon and medical researcher, state that a lack of dietary fiber is a major cause of appendicitis, varicose veins, diverticulosis, colon cancer, hiatal hernias, constipation, and other health problems. mcccxlix19 Flesh foods. In 1866 Ellen White wrote that ―the liability to take disease is increased tenfold by meat eating.‖ mcccl20 Further, in 1869 she said that ―meat should not be placed before our children.‖ mcccli21 Why was she so explicit? Because the practice of meat eating is detrimental to physical, mental, and spiritual health. Physical impact: Ellen White wrote that meat eating increases the ―liability to disease . . . tenfold.‖ Further, it causes obesity, mccclii22 sudden death (heart attack or stroke), mcccliii23 ―unwholesome condition‖ of bones (probably osteoporosis), mcccliv24 and cancer. mccclv25 Contrary to conventional thinking, she called it ―a mistake to suppose that muscular strength depends on the use of animal food. The needs of the system can be better supplied, and more vigorous health can be enjoyed, without its use.‖ mccclvi26 In addition, ―the use of the flesh of animals tends to cause a grossness [obesity] of body.‖ mccclvii27 Mental impact: She cautioned that ―students would accomplish much more in their studies if they never tasted meat. When the animal part of the human agent is strengthened by meat eating, the intellectual powers diminish proportionately.‖ mccclviii28 Spiritual impact: Even more important than the physical and mental liabilities of meat eating is the fact that the ―religious life can be more successfully gained and maintained if meat is discarded, for this diet stimulates into intense activity lustful propensities, and enfeebles the moral and spiritual nature.‖ mccclix29
For Ellen White, ―diet reform is progressive.‖ mccclx30 For this reason, she said frequently that she never felt it her ―duty to say that no one should taste of meat under any circumstances. To say this when the people have been educated to live on flesh to so great an extent, would be carrying matters to extreme.‖ mccclxi31 At the same time, she did not soften her words when eternal issues were at stake. In the context of those who were proclaiming the messages of the three angels (Rev. 14) and thus were preparing for Christ‘s return, she said: ―Among those who are waiting for the coming of the Lord, meat eating will eventually be done away; flesh will cease to form a part of their diet.‖ mccclxii32 Meat eating will be eliminated ―before His people can stand before Him a perfected people.‖ mccclxiii33 Ellen White spoke directly to church leaders regarding meat eating: No one should be a ―teacher of the people‖ who, by teaching or example, ―contradicts‖ the principles of health reform. mccclxiv34 Physicians ―who use flesh meat and prescribe it for their patients, should not be employed in our institutions.‖ mccclxv35 Ministers who eat meat ―set an evil example,‖ and make it difficult for others to have ―confidence‖ in them. mccclxvi36 What Scientific Research Indicates Regarding a Meat Diet Meat and obesity: It is difficult to become obese when following humanity‘s original diet (Genesis 1-3—fruits, grains, nuts, and vegetables). Recent studies indicate that those who eat a meat diet are much more likely to be obese. In the Adventist Mortality Study 16 percent of vegetarian women and 8 percent of men were obese whereas in the non-vegetarian Adventist group 32 percent of the women and 20 percent of the men were obese. mccclxvii37 Because meat is high in fat, it contains many calories in a small space and is thus a high-caloric-density food. Meat, obesity, and cancer: But obesity leads to further liabilities. Obesity increases the risk of coronary heart disease by 50-100 percent, and the correlation with the risk of cancer increases dramatically. Obesity increases the risk of cancers such as breast cancer, mccclxviii38 endometrial cancer, mccclxix39 prostate cancer, colon cancer, mccclxx40 and other cancers. ―People who eat high-fat
323 diets tend to be heavier and to eat more meat and fewer fruits and vegetables, so their risk of cancer also is increasing.‖ mccclxxi41 In Hiroshima, Japan, breast cancer was 3.8 times greater in people consuming meat daily compared to vegetarians. Daily users of eggs had 2.8 times greater risk, and butter and cheese users 2-3 times greater risk than non-consumers of these items. mccclxxii42 In a study of 265,118 Japanese, meat eaters had 2.5 times greater risk of pancreatic cancer. mccclxxiii43 Immune system: The human immune system is directly affected by what one eats, and thus the body‘s resistance to cancer may be the most important factor in preventing cancer. Excesses or deficiencies of any nutrient adversely affects the immune system. For example, a high protein diet depresses T-lymphocyte cells, mccclxxiv44 and an unreasonably low protein diet, as in Kwashiorkor, depresses the immune system. Obesity depresses the immune system, as does starvation. A high serum cholesterol depresses the immune system, as do excess doses of vitamins C or E. mccclxxv45 Meat and cancer: The mortality ratio involving ovarian cancer is distinctly different between (a) Adventist lacto-ovo-vegetarians (15.9/100,000), (b) those using meat one to three times a week (18/100,000), (c) the general population of California (24/100,000), and (d) Adventists using meat four or more times weekly (26.4/100,000). mccclxxvi46 In that same study comparing the first three groups, the mortality ratios for breast cancer were: (a) 64/100,000; (b) 73.3/100,000; and (c) 81.6/100,000. mccclxxvii47 Animal Products Increase Death Risk
Heavy consumers of animal products (meat, milk, eggs, cheese) had a 3.6 times greater risk of death from prostate cancer compared to low consumers. mccclxxviii48 The study also reported that those who eat meat more than three times a week increase their risk of fatal or near-fatal bladder cancer. mccclxxix49 Eating meat five or more times a week may triple the risk of coronary heart disease for a 40-year-old male. mccclxxx50 The American Cancer Society‘s 1996 report emphasized that ―diets high in foods from plant sources [vegetables, fruits, whole gains, beans] have been associated with a decreased risk, whereas diets high in fat and red meat have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.‖ Further, ―intake of animal fat, red meats, and dairy products has been found to be associated with an increase in the risk of prostate cancer.‖ mccclxxxi51 Dietary patterns in fifteen countries were compared with lymphoma death rates. A positive correlation existed between beef and all animal protein (fish being an exception). Vegetable protein foods were negatively correlated. mccclxxxii52 Seventh-day Adventists in the United States consume as much fat as the general population. mccclxxxiii53 Yet, Adventists have only half as many cancers, even cancers not related to tobacco and alcohol. The explanation apparently lies in the difference in the kind of fat consumed. The National Research Council stated that cancer is most closely related to total fat and saturated fat. mccclxxxiv54 Meat and cancer germs: When Ellen White wrote that ―tuberculosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases‖ are caused by ―tuberculosis and cancerous germs,‖ the medical world scoffed, and continued to do so for many decades. But not today. mccclxxxv55 In 1974, milk from leukemic cows was fed to six chimpanzees. Two died with leukemia at nine months of age, demonstrating that cancer viruses can be transmitted, even between different species. mccclxxxvi56 The chicken leukosis virus can be found in five to ten percent of all eggs. mccclxxxvii57 Meat and diabetes: In the Adventist Health Study, those who consumed meat six or more days a week had a 3.8 times greater risk than vegetarians of dying of diabetes. mccclxxxviii58 Meat and endurance: A three-day, high-carbohydrate diet (such as the original
324 diet, (Gen. 1-3) produced almost three times the endurance (167 minutes) as the three-day, high-protein, fat diet (57 minutes) in a study of Swedish athletes. mccclxxxix59 Meat and essential fatty acids: God‘s original diet (Gen. 1-3) contained no animal fat but had sufficient essential poly-unsaturated fatty acids from plant sources. Adequate linoleic acid, found in grains, reduces hypertension (high blood pressure) mcccxc60 and platelet stickiness, and the aggregation of red blood cells mcccxci61 lowers blood cholesterol mcccxcii62 and reduces the risk of heart attacks mcccxciii63 and ventricular fibrillation. mcccxciv64 Meat and longevity: Non-meat-eaters have an increased life expectancy beyond eighty years although there does not appear to be an increase in maximal life-span. mcccxcv65 Salt. Although Ellen White stated that salt was ―essential for the blood,‖ mcccxcvi66 she also advised against using ―an undue amount of salt.‖ mcccxcvii67 Further, ―a free use of‖ salt (as well as sugar and milk) ―is positively injurious.‖ mcccxcviii68 Tea and coffee. For Ellen White, using tea and coffee as a beverage ―is a sin, an injurious indulgence.‖ mcccxcix69 After the immediate stimulating effect ―a feeling of depression‖ sets in. mcd70 With continual use, the abuser of the nervous system will experience ―headaches, wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, indigestion, trembling, and many other evils, for they [tea, coffee, and ―many other popular drinks‖] wear away the life forces.‖ mcdi71 Both tea and coffee are ―poisonous,‖ and ―Christians should let it [them] alone,‖ mcdii72 a position validated in current research. mcdiii73 Caffeine, a major culprit in tea and coffee, is easily available in many popular drinks (cola drinks) and over-the-counter medications. Physiological effects of caffeine are apparent in adults at doses of only 100-200 mg.—the equivalent of one to three cups of coffee. But for a child (age 1-5) one can of caffeinated soda is equal to four cups of coffee!
The Adventist Health Study found that the use of even one cup of coffee daily was associated with a 33 percent increase in the risk of fatal heart disease in men. Adventists who use two or more cups of coffee daily are reported to have a greater risk of fatal colon and bladder cancer. mcdiv74 The caffeine syndrome is recognized by aggressiveness, hyperactivity, and sometimes psychotic behavior. Caffeine and the excess ingestion of xanthine alkaloids (found in coffee, tea, cocoa, and some popular beverages) affect people differently, usually observed in the abnormal stimulation of the nervous system and the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. mcdv75 Humanity’s Original Diet Original Diet. Ellen White‘s simple, positive statement regarding the best diet for human beings has stood the test of time and research: ―In order to know what are the best foods, we must study God‘s original plan for man‘s diet. . . . Grains, fruits, nuts and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator.‖ mcdvi76 The affirming research is voluminous and growing yearly. Nuts. Although the scientific community has long ignored nuts, or thought them too high in fat to be recommended, evidence now substantiates Ellen White‘s teachings. She included them in the ―diet chosen for us by our Creator.‖ mcdvii77 Further, she said that ―some nuts are not as wholesome as others. Almonds are preferable to peanuts.‖ mcdviii78 Aware of some of the dangers of too many nuts in the diet (because of their high fat content), she warned that ―too large a quantity of nut food is an injury . . . but . . . all can eat freely of fruit.‖ mcdix79 In the Adventist Health Study men who ate nuts 4-5 times a week had only half as many fatal heart attacks as those who rarely ate nuts. mcdx80 Walnuts and almonds have been shown to lower serum lipids (reducing risk of atherosclerosis). mcdxi81 Fruits and vegetables. Recent research has focused on the health benefits of a diet
325 rich in vegetables and fruits. ―Vegetables and fruits are complex foods containing more than 100 beneficial vitamins, minerals, fiber, and other substances. Scientists do not yet know which of the nutrients or other substances in fruits and vegetables may be protective against cancer. The principal possibilities include specific vitamins and minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals—carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenes, sterols, indoles, and phenols—that are present in foods of plant origin. . . . Until more is known about specific food components, the best advice is to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day.‖ mcdxii82 The Adventist Health Study indicated that vegetarians consume twice as much vitamin A and four times as much vitamin C as people in the general population. The antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E may lower the risk of cancer and coronary heart disease. Eating four servings of legumes per week decreases risk of pancreatic cancer much more than eating legumes only once a week. mcdxiii83 Where does one find these antioxidants? In carrots, squash, tomatoes, leafy vegetables, dried fruits, fresh strawberries, melons, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussell sprouts, etc. In a study of elderly people, high consumers of these foods had only 30 percent of the cancer mortality as that of low consumers. mcdxiv84 In the 1996 American Cancer Society‘s Report, reference was made to the ―oxygen-induced damage to tissues that occurs constantly as a result of normal metabolism. Because such damage is associated with increased cancer risk, antioxidant nutrients are thought to protect against cancer. Antioxidant nutrients include vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and carotenoids. Studies suggest that people who eat more fruits and vegetables containing these antioxidants have a lower risk for cancer.‖ mcdxv85 Those eating cabbage once a week had only one-third the risk of colon cancer compared to those who ate it once a month. mcdxvi86 Those getting adequate vitamin A had only one-third the risk of lung cancer compared to those with low intake of vitamin A. mcdxvii87 Oral and pharyngeal cancer were reduced by half in those consuming high quantities of fruits and vegetables. mcdxviii88 Adequate amounts of the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E have been shown to reduce the risk of cataracts. Those who consumed fewer than 3.5 servings of fruit or vegetables daily had a five to ten times increased risk of cataracts! mcdxix89
Foods high in potassium . . . like oranges, bananas, potatoes, and milk . . . reduce risk of stroke by as much as 40 percent. mcdxx90 Fruits and vegetables at the same meal. Ellen White counseled that ―we should avoid eating vegetables and fruit at the same meal.‖ mcdxxi91 ―At one meal use bread and fruit, at the next bread and vegetables.‖ mcdxxii92 Whenever possible, Mrs. White followed this practice: ―I eat the most simple foods, prepared in the most simple way. For months my principal diet has been vermicelli and canned tomatoes, cooked together. This I eat with zwieback. Then I have also stewed fruit of some kind and sometimes lemon pie. Dried corn, cooked with milk or a little cream, is another dish that I sometimes use.‖ mcdxxiii93 What are the problems when fruit and vegetables are combined? For many with a ―feeble‖ digestion, the mix will cause ―distress,‖ and ―inability to put forth mental effort.‖ mcdxxiv94 Some children ―become fretful and peevish.‖ mcdxxv95 Ellen White saw in vision the cause of a minister‘s sickness: ―I took notice of your diet. You eat too great a variety at one meal. Fruit and vegetables taken at one meal produce acidity of the stomach; then impurity of the blood results, and the mind is not clear because the digestion is imperfect.‖ mcdxxvi96 Mrs. White advised students to eat fruit and grains rather than vegetables for supper: ―Let the students have the third meal prepared without vegetables, but with simple, wholesome food, such as fruit and bread.‖ mcdxxvii97
326 The White family considered vegetables to include peas, beans, potatoes, turnips, parsnips, onions, cabbages, and squashes (although some of these would be classified as fruits botanically). Fruits included tomatoes, apples, pears, peaches, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, huckleberries, grapes, cranberries, and raisins. Grains (or seeds) included wheat, corn, rye, barley, oatmeal, rice, farina, cornstarch, ―and the like.‖ mcdxxviii98 Some have wondered about Ellen White‘s inclusion of tomatoes within the fruit group, but that she did, according to common usage. mcdxxix99 Olives were an item that could be safely eaten at any meal. mcdxxx100 Milk. Ellen White‘s counsel regarding milk has often been misunderstood both by those who freely use it and those who avoid it. On one hand, she clearly says that the time will come when ―milk of the cows will also be excluded from the diet of God‘s commandment-keeping people.‖ mcdxxxi101 However, again demonstrating Ellen White‘s common sense as well as enlightened counsel, she also said that, in her day, ―as the situation now is,‖ mcdxxxii102 the time to ―discard‖ or ―exclude‖ milk had not come. She gave two reasons: (1) The poor were not able to make the dietary adjustment immediately: ―I cannot say to them, ‗You must not eat eggs or milk or cream. You must use no butter in the preparation of food.‘ The gospel must be preached to the poor, and the time has not yet come to prescribe the strictest diet.‖ mcdxxxiii103 Common sense indicated that ―until we can teach them how to prepare health reform foods that are palatable, nourishing, and yet inexpensive, we are not at liberty to present the most advanced propositions regarding health reform diet.‖ mcdxxxiv104 (2) Disease in animals was increasing, and for ―safety‖ reasons it would be wise to discard milk from the diet. mcdxxxv105 But while counseling that we should prepare for the day when milk will not be ―safe,‖ she emphasized that milk, or its ―equivalent,‖ mcdxxxvi106 is still part of ―the most healthful diet.‖ mcdxxxvii107 Milk seems to be the most available source of Vitamin B-12; without milk, for most people, supplements of B-12 may be necessary. Ellen White‘s common sense also warns against extreme positions. For some, prematurely discarding milk without providing its equivalent may cause sickness, even death. mcdxxxviii108 For others, it would be an unwarranted financial hardship to find an equivalent for milk. mcdxxxix109 Her common sense urged her to warn against premature proscriptions that would make some people the arbiters as to what others should be putting on their tables, thus ―creating a time of trouble beforehand.‖ mcdxl110 Above all, ―we should not allow differences of opinion to create disunion.‖ mcdxli111
So, the question remains: When should we ―discard‖ milk from the diet? In 1901 the time had ―not yet come.‖ mcdxlii112 When the time does come, ―God will reveal it.‖ mcdxliii113 We should wait, using our best judgment, always with the principle of ―known duty‖ mcdxliv114 leading us individually, ―waiting until the circumstances demand it, and the Lord prepares the way for it.‖ mcdxlv115 Grains. Ellen White‘s emphasis on grains as an essential component of an adequate diet has been unequivocally validated in recent research. ―Grains such as wheat, rice, oats, barley, and the foods made from them constitute the base of healthful diets as illustrated in the Food Guide Pyramid. Healthful diets contain six to 11 standard servings of foods from this group each day. . . . Grains are an important source of many vitamins and minerals such as folate, calcium, and selenium, all of which have been associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.‖ mcdxlvi116 Alcohol affects brain cells. When Ellen White wrote in 1885 that alcoholic beverages destroy ―reason and life,‖ and in 1905 that such drinking ―destroys the sensitive nerves of the brain,‖ she sounded like an overzealous temperance orator. mcdxlvii117 But in 1970 research indicated that ―even the moderate imbiber may incur some
327 loss of irreplaceable brain cells—every time he drinks. . . . The only real difference between his loss of brain tissue and that of the heavy drinker is one of degree.‖ mcdxlviii118 The ability to make decisions concerning moral issues begins to slip at very low alcohol intake levels (much below what is considered adequate to lower heart attack risk). mcdxlix119 Caffeine affects spirituality. Ellen White may not have known that she was many decades ahead of scientific confirmation when she warned that ―all such stimulants and narcotics as tea, coffee, tobacco, alcohol, and morphine . . . exert a pernicious influence upon moral character. The earlier these hurtful habits are formed, the more firmly will they hold their victim in slavery to lust, and the more certainly will they lower the standard of spirituality.‖ mcdl120 But this truth is reflected in current studies. Researchers, among other findings, note that as coffee drinkers grow older, their coffee consumption increases. On a spiritual plane, this increase in consumption accompanies a decrease in religious involvement. mcdli121 Faulty diet and poor scholarship. In 1884 Ellen White stated that ―nine tenths of the wickedness among the children of today is caused by intemperance in eating and drinking.‖ Six years later she wrote that ―the diet materially affects the mind and disposition.‖ mcdlii122 Today widespread evidence indicates that there is a correlation between poor diet habits and poor scholarship. Better-fed children get better grades in school. When students with poor grades and poor diets are given nutritionally enriched meals, their grades and other scholastic indicators improve. mcdliii123 Non-dietary Features of Health Reform Objectionable aspects of city living. In 1890 Ellen White spoke of Satan at work ―poisoning the atmosphere.‖ In 1902 she predicted that city life ―will grow more and more objectionable,‖ and ―a peril of health,‖ with the ―prevalence of foul air, impure water, impure food,‖ including ―poisonous gases.‖ She looked to the day when many will move to the country, ―for wickedness and corruption will increase to such a degree that the very atmosphere of the cities will seem to be polluted.‖ mcdliv124 Modern research validates this warning. Beneficial effect of sunlight. Ellen White wrote in 1865 that the atmosphere of rooms that are not exposed to light and air ―is poisonous, because it has not been purified by light and air.‖ Why? ―Death-producing germs abound in dark, neglected corners, in decaying refuse . . . . Perfect cleanliness, plenty of sunlight, careful attention to sanitation in every detail of the home life, are essential to freedom from disease and to the cheerfulness and vigor of the inmates of the home.‖ mcdlv125 Exercise and physical health. Exercise directly affects the circulation of the blood. Contrary to conventional medicine in the nineteenth century, exercise is vital to recovery from most diseases as well as to the prevention of disease. In 1872 Ellen White wrote that ―no exercise . . . can take the place of walking. By it the circulation of the blood is greatly involved.‖
Two years earlier she urged that ―all who can possibly do so ought to walk in the open air every day, summer and winter.‖ Why? ―The muscles and veins are enabled better to perform their work. There will be increased vitality, which is so necessary to health.‖ In 1905 she gave several reasons why ―inactivity is a fruitful cause of disease‖: (1) slow circulation of the blood; (2) impurities are not expelled through the skin; (3) lungs are not fed with fresh air; (4) a double burden rests on the excretory organs. mcdlvi126 Exercise reduces risk of heart disease. mcdlvii127 Sedentary people have twice as much risk of heart disease and high blood pressure as physically active people. mcdlviii128 Even medium levels of physical activity in men protects against strokes. mcdlix129 The relative risk of mortality for women ages 50-74 was one-third less in the most active quartile compared to the least active. mcdlx130 Exercise may also reduce the risk of
328 cancer of the colon, prostate, and breast, as well as diabetes. mcdlxi131 After emphasizing that a person should be moderately active for 30 minutes or more on most days of the week, the American Cancer Society‘s 1996 report noted that ―physical activity can help protect against some cancers, either by balancing caloric intake with energy expenditures or by other mechanisms. An imbalance of caloric intake and output can lead to overweight, obesity, and increased risk for cancers at several sites: colon and rectum, prostate, endometrium, breast (among postmenopausal women), and kidney.‖ mcdlxii132 Exercise may boost the immune system. mcdlxiii133 Exercise and mental ability. Ellen White wrote that ―physical inaction lessens not only mental but moral power.‖ mcdlxiv134 Exercise linked with the ability to think was noted in a study of twenty persons who exercised three times a week for six months. Conclusion: they were not only twenty percent fitter, they also were seventy percent better at making decisions than before beginning their exercise regimen. mcdlxv135 A walk after meals. Mrs. White clearly stated that we should not ―engage in brain labor immediately after a meal.‖ Further, we should not consider this counsel ―a matter of trifling importance.‖ ―To engage in deep study or violent exercise immediately after eating, hinders the digestive process. . . . A short walk after a meal, with the head erect and the shoulders back, exercising moderately, is a great benefit.‖ mcdlxvi136 In 1964 Gerhard Volkheimer, M. D., a cardiovascular researcher in Berlin, reported that he had found that ―physical inactivity can lead to the accumulation of chyle (fat) in the thoracic duct. And any sudden movement can apparently propel enough chyle into the blood to produce a coronary embolism.‖ mcdlxvii137 Because of his research, Dr. Volkheimer strongly advised an after-meal walk to avoid the risk of a coronary attack. Adequate sleep. Mrs. White included a program of adequate sleep as part of her eight natural remedies. mcdlxviii138 After linking mental vigor with physical health, she wrote: ―Proper periods of sleep and rest and an abundance of physical exercise are essential to health of body and mind. To rob nature of her hours for rest and recuperation, by allowing one man to do the work of four, or of three, or even of two, will result in irreparable loss.‖ mcdlxix139 In the Belloc-Breslow study it was noted that sleeping seven to eight hours nightly is one of the health factors that extends life by as much as eleven years. mcdlxx140 Trust in God. Long before many had linked health with spiritual values, Mrs. White wrote: ―Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and prolong life.‖ mcdlxxi141 A strong correlation exists between the mind and the body in physical recovery, even in the program of reversing heart disease. mcdlxxii142 Mrs. White was equally clear about how spiritual values not only help in curing disease, but are perhaps ―health‘s greatest safeguard.‖ mcdlxxiii143 Literature is abundant that documents how faith and social support from family and friends encourage mental and spiritual well-being. mcdlxxiv144 People who attend church regularly have fewer illnesses than non-churchgoers. Non-religious Jews are twice as likely to have a coronary attack as synagogue-attending Jews. mcdlxxv145
Cancer, a Virus On page 322 we discussed Ellen White‘s instruction regarding dietary factors that may cause cancer. At the time she wrote, eminent men and women of science emphatically declared that cancer was not infectious, that there was no cancer germ. Decades later, in 1956, Wendell Stanley, a Ph.D. virologist and Nobel Prize winner at the University of California, asserted his belief that ―viruses cause most or all human cancers.‖ He described viruses as ―midget germs‖ that ―lurk in the human body for years, even a lifetime;
329 some cause trouble, some do not. . . . In some cases, the cancer viruses might become active by aging, dietary indiscretions, hormonal imbalance, chemicals, radiation, or a combination of these stresses, and malignancies may follow.‖ mcdlxxvi146 Much cancer research has been done since, lending support to Ellen White‘s reference to ―cancerous germs, mcdlxxvii147 but currently it is believed that there are other, more common, causes of cancer as well. Dr. Robert J. Huebner, chief of the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health at Bethesda, Maryland, reported in 1961 that ―there isn‘t the slightest doubt in our minds that human cancers are caused by viruses. To this extent, they are simply infectious diseases.‖ mcdlxxviii148 Table 11-5: Virus implicated in various cancers Agent “Cancer” Predisposing Conditions Epstein-Barr virus Burkitt‘s lymphoma Possibly malaria Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Herpes hominis Carcinoma cervix Promiscuity/venereal infection Papovaviruses (SV 40; JC, BK) Progressive multifocal encephalopathy Immunosuppression Unknown virus Kaposi‘s sarcoma Acquired immunodeficiency syndromes Hepatitis B Primary hepatocellular carcinoma Chronic hepatitis B infection Human Papillomaviruses Genital tumors Venereal infection T-cell leukemia virus 1.

Ward, editors, Immunological Aspects of Cancer (Boston: Martinus Nijhoff Publishing, 1985), pp. 225-229. Contributing Causes of Cancer Associated factors with aging: Note Ellen White‘s interesting comment in 1864 regarding how aging may affect certain factors that stimulate latent cancer germs: ―Cancerous humor [bodily fluid] which would lay [lie] dormant in the system [throughout] their lifetime, is inflamed, and commences its eating, destructive work.‖ mcdlxxix149 Drugs: Referring to a popular treatment for disease in the nineteenth century, Ellen White declared: ―This is the effect of calomel . . . . It inflames the joints, and often sends rottenness into the bones. It frequently manifests itself in tumors, ulcers, and cancers, years after it has been introduced into the system.‖ mcdlxxx150 Tobacco: In 1864 Mrs. White added her voice to the few in her day who had recognized that tobacco is a ―poison of the most deceitful and malignant kind . . . a slow poison.‖ mcdlxxxi151
Among the many cancers caused by smoking, lung cancer among ex-servicemen became prevalent in the mid-1930s in the United States as a direct result of heavy smoking during World War I. It takes about twenty years for cancer-producing results to become obvious. Before the 1930s, cancer of the lung was an extremely rare disease. In 1995, in the United States alone, 418,000 deaths were caused by smoking. mcdlxxxii152 Unless the present trend is reversed, it is expected that by the year 2025, ten million people will die annually as a consequence of smoking tobacco. mcdlxxxiii153
330 But tobacco smokers also show high death rates from coronary artery disease. mcdlxxxiv154 Indeed, ―those who acquire and indulge the unnatural appetite for tobacco, do this at the expense of health.‖ mcdlxxxv155 Although the major risk factor for lung cancer is tobacco, diet also affects risk. But a ―greater consumption of vegetables, fruits, or both together has also been associated with a lower risk of lung cancer. . . . Fruits and vegetables reduce cancer risk whether or not people smoke.‖ mcdlxxxvi156 Parental smoking is a significant factor in their children‘s health, even their death. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, say that ―more young children are killed by parental smoking than by all unintentional injuries combined.‖ They attribute 2,800 deaths to low birth weight caused by mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Another 2,000 deaths are due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) caused by secondhand smoke; another 1,000 are caused by asthma. The same research said that an additional 5.4 million children suffer nonfatal asthma and ear infections triggered by parents‘ smoking, costing an estimated $4.6 billion annually to treat. mcdlxxxvii157 Further research indicates that pregnant women who smoke more than ten cigarettes a day run the risk of giving birth to a child who will develop ―conduct disorder,‖ defined as ―serious‖ antisocial behavior, for six months or more. Boys whose mothers smoked during pregnancy were 4.4 times more likely to engage in antisocial activities, including lying, stealing, arson, vandalism, or cruelty than boys whose mothers did not smoke or smoked fewer than ten cigarettes a day. Studies suggest that smoking causes changes in a child‘s brain functioning. mcdlxxxviii158 Drugs and birth defects. In 1865 Mrs. White linked birth defects with poisonous drugs administered by physicians. In 1890 she warned that thousands ―born deaf, blind, diseased, or idiotic‖ were casualties of their parents‘ indulgences in alcoholic beverages. mcdlxxxix159 Scientific research beginning in the 1950s has validated this warning, including the negative effects of smoking and caffeine consumption on the fetus. mcdxc160 During pregnancy even ―aspirin should be taken only in small amounts and not over long periods of time.‖ mcdxci161 Physical activity for the sick and the convalescent. In the 1860s, bed-rest and the rest-cure were standard recuperative procedures and remained so into the mid-twentieth century. Contrary to conventional medical practice, Ellen White declared in 1867 that she had been frequently ―shown that the sick should be taught that it is wrong to suspend all physical labor in order to regain health. . . . To suspend activity in order to regain health, is a great error.‖ Three years later: ―If invalids would recover health, they should not discontinue physical exercise; for they will thus increase muscular weakness and general debility.‖ Further, ―the blood is not enabled to expel the impurities as it would if active circulation were induced by exercise.‖ mcdxcii162 Mervyn G. Hardinge, M.D., one-time Dean, School of Health, Loma Linda University, reviewed this amazing 180-degree turn in medical practice. ―The ‗rest cures‘ of the recent past have today given way to programs of occupational and educational therapy.‖ mcdxciii163 Hypnosis and medical practice. Ellen White‘s condemnation of hypnotism has been supported by many modern psychiatric practitioners—and ridiculed by others. In speaking to a physician in 1901, she said: ―No man or woman should exercise his or her will to control the senses or reason of another, so that the mind of the person is rendered passively subject to the will of the one who is exercising the control. This science [hypnotherapy] may appear to be something beautiful, but it is a science which you are in no case to handle. . . . Temporary relief may be felt, but the mind of the one thus controlled is never again so strong and reliable.‖ mcdxciv164

In reference to the use of hypnotism in dentistry, two dentists authored an article entitled, ―Psychological Evaluation of Hypnosis in Dentistry,‖ in which they concluded: ―In [a] study of the personality characteristics of dentists who employ hypnosis in their practice, the subjects consisted of 34 dentists. . . . The results indicated that most well-adjusted dentists do not tend to use hypnosis. . . . ―The vast majority of practicing dentists feel it is possible to render adequate service without employing hypnosis. . . . Hypnosis, in general, is not held in high esteem by the dental profession. . . . ―Dentists who are well-adjusted, who are relatively satisfied with themselves, and who obtain satisfaction from the conventional practice of their profession do not tend to use hypnosis or to become interested in its use. It is as if they do not need such an additional and unusual source of gratification.‖ mcdxcv165 Mind-body relationships. In 1867 Ellen White linked the ―sickness of body and mind to nearly all its dissatisfied feelings and discontented repinings.‖ mcdxcvi166 In 1872 she urged physicians to ―cure the body through the mind,‖ because ―a great deal of the sickness which afflicts humanity has its origin in the mind and can only be cured by restoring the mind to health. . . . Heart sickness makes many dyspeptics, for mental trouble has a paralyzing influence upon the digestive organs.‖ mcdxcvii167 In 1905 Mrs. White expanded these psychosomatic concepts in noting that ―disease is sometimes produced, and is often greatly aggravated, by the imagination. . . . Many die of disease, the cause of which is wholly imaginary.‖ mcdxcviii168 Ancient medical science attested that the mind and body cannot be separated. But this truth has not always been translated into medical practice. In the latter half of the twentieth century, medical research generally affirmed not only that health and happiness are intertwined but that faulty emotional patterns can actually cause disease. mcdxcix169 In 1993 psychiatrist George F. Solomon, of the University of California at Los Angeles, said: ―The mind and body cannot be separated. The mind is the brain, and the brain is part of the body. The brain regulates and influences many physiological functions, including immunity. Mental and physical well-being are inextricably intertwined.‖ Dr. Solomon coined the term ―psychoimmunology‖ in 1964 (a term that was expanded to ―psychoneuroimmunology‖ [PNI] by Robert Ader). After twenty-five years of studying the biological mechanisms by which emotions and attitudes affect one‘s resistance to disease, Solomon said, ―We have studied people with a variety of illnesses, and people with very good coping skills tend to have a greater speed of recovery.‖ md170 In 1995, Healing and The Mind, a remarkable book by Bill Moyers based on the television series with the same title, was devoted to two important questions: ―How do thoughts and feelings influence health? How is healing related to the mind?‖ Author Bill Moyers and his team directed these questions to physicians in large public hospitals and small community clinics. They talked with people in stress reduction clinics and therapeutic support groups. They explored these questions with scientists on the frontier of mind/body research. Their answers were remarkably consistent: the mind controls the body for good or ill. Moyers concluded that ―talking with different doctors during this journey, I realize that we do need a new medical paradigm that goes beyond ‗body parts‘ medicine, and not only for the patient‘s sake. At a time when the cost of health care is skyrocketing, the potential economic impact of mind/body medicine is considerable.‖ Moyer quoted Eric J. Cassell approvingly when Cassell wrote that healing powers ―consist only in and no more than in allowing, causing, or bringing to bear those things or forces for getting better (whatever they may be) that
332 already exist in the patient.‖ mdi171 Dean Ornish, in an extended interview that flowed from Ornish‘s ground-breaking research on reversing arteriosclerosis through non-invasive methods such as diet, exercise, and stress-reduction, said: ―Taking into account cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, genetics, and all of the other known risk factors still explains only about half of the heart disease we see. Clearly, something else is going on. My clinical experience, as well as what we‘re showing in our research, suggests that psychological, emotional, and even spiritual factors are important, not only in terms of how they affect our behaviors, like diet and exercise, but also in more direct ways.‖ mdii172
Electrical currents in brain and nervous system. In 1934 members of the Mayo Clinic staff in Rochester, Minnesota, were discussing the electrical action of the brain. In 1962 Dr. Ernest Weber, president of Polytechnic Institute, Brooklyn, New York, wrote that he knew of no greater modern wonder than the discovery of ―electromagnetic waves.‖ In 1954 an article in The Scientific American reviewed the developing science of electromagnetic waves: ―Twenty-five years ago [1929] Hans Berger, a German psychiatrist, . . . began to publish some strange little pictures consisting of nothing but wavy lines. They should have caused great excitement among his colleagues, because he claimed that they showed the electrical activity of the human brain. But in fact no one took them seriously. For several years no one even bothered to repeat his experiments. . . . In the quarter of a century since then the study of his little wavy lines has grown into a new department of science called electroencephalography. Today several hundred laboratories in the United States and a similar number in Europe are recording and interpreting charts of the electrical discharges of human brains. Their total annual output of charts would girdle the earth.‖ mdiii173 Ellen White wrote in 1869: ―Whatever disturbs the circulation of the electric currents in the nervous system lessens the strength of the vital powers; and the result is a deadening of the sensibilities of the mind.‖ Three years later she declared: ―This class [physical laborers who use the brain powers very little] fall more readily if attacked by disease; the system is vitalized by the electrical force of the brain to resist disease.‖ mdiv174 In 1903 she added: ―The influence of the mind on the body, as well as of the body on the mind, should be emphasized. The electric power of the brain, promoted by mental activity, vitalizes the whole system, and is thus an invaluable aid in resisting disease. This should be made plain. The power of the will and the importance of self-control, both in the preservation and in the recovery of health, the depressing and even ruinous effect of anger, discontent, selfishness, or impurity, and, on the other hand, the marvelous life-giving power to be found in cheerfulness, unselfishness, gratitude, should also be shown.‖ mdv175 Caution in the use of the X-ray. Ellen White not only endorsed the proper use of the X-ray, she permitted X-ray treatment for a black spot on her forehead. mdvi176 But she sounded an early warning about overexposure in X-ray therapy. Speaking in regard to new ―electrical appliances‖ being installed in the Paradise Valley Sanitarium, she said: ―I was instructed that some connected with the institution were introducing things for the treatment of the sick that were not safe. The application of some of these electrical treatments would involve the patient in serious difficulties, imperiling life. . . . I have been instructed that the X-ray is not the great blessing that some suppose it to be. If used unwisely it may do much harm. The results of some of the electrical treatments are similar to the results of using stimulants. There is a weakness that follows.‖ mdvii177 Through the years, the effects of
333 excessive X-ray radiation in the treatment of disease have become well known—tissue breakdown with the potential risk of anemia, leukemia, cataract formation, and shortening of life. But when used wisely, the positive results of X-ray diagnostics and treatment are incalculable. Prenatal influences. From 1865 to her last years, Ellen White emphasized the various facets of prenatal influences. Yet, not until the 1950s was this concept given credibility in scientific circles. Since then, a tidal wave of concurrence has flooded the medical world. In 1865 Mrs. White wrote: ―The irritability, nervousness, and despondency, manifested by the mother, will mark the character of her child. In past generations, if mothers had informed themselves in regard to the laws of their being, they would have understood that their constitutional strength, as well as the tone of their morals, and their mental faculties, would in a great measure be represented in their offspring.‖ mdviii178
In 1954 Ashley Montagu wrote: ―There is now sufficient evidence from many sources to indicate that the unborn child can be variously affected by physical changes in the mother, and that although a woman cannot ‗mark‘ her baby by seeing something unpleasant before he is born, nor make him a
poet by reading Keats and Shelley during her pregnancy, there are ways in which she definitely can influence his behavior pattern. It is largely up to her, and to those surrounding her during her pregnancy, whether her infant will be born a happy, healthy, sweet-tempered individual or an ill-adjusted neurotic.‖ mdix179 Corroborating the research of many, Leland H. Scott wrote in 1967: ―There is a growing evidence that chemical irregularities in the mother‘s blood brought about by endocrine imbalance, dietary deficiencies, or ill health may have serious effects. Maternal malnutrition often results in the unborn child being deprived of essential vitamins or nutrients necessary for its normal growth and health. Childhood abnormalities, such as rickets, nervous instability, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy, have been found to result from serious malnutrition in the mother at certain points during the period of pregnancy.‖ mdx180 First years of a child‟s life. Tightly connected with the concept of prenatal influences is the belief that the first few years of a child‘s life set the life course. In 1881 Ellen White wrote that the ―parents‘ work must begin with the child in its infancy.‖ mdxi181 More precisely, parents should ―properly discipline . . . children during the first three years of their lives. Do not allow them to form their wishes and desires. The mother must be mind for her child. The first three years is the time in which to bend the tiny twig.‖ mdxii182 In the overall training of the child, in areas beyond discipline, Ellen White is emphatic: ―Too much importance cannot be placed on the early training of children. The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of life have more to do with forming his character than all that it learns in future years.‖ mdxiii183 The importance of a child‘s first three years of learning was stressed in 1997 by a White House panel of experts, as reported in The Washington Post. The scientists and child development specialists presented ―compelling new research showing that a child‘s language, thinking and emotional health are largely formed before age 3. . . . Not only are most brain synapses—connections between brain cells—formed before age 3, the report said, ‗those synapses that have been activated many times by repeated early experience tend to become permanent; the synapses that are not used tend to become eliminated.‘‖ mdxiv184 Modern Research Confirms Health Principles Clive McCay. The late Dr. Clive M. McCay, professor of nutrition at Cornell‘s New York State College of Agriculture
334 and Life Sciences (where he taught for thirty-seven years—1925-1962), was recognized worldwide as a pioneer and authority in nutritional theory, research, and history. mdxv185 After coming into contact with the health principles of Ellen White through Helen Chen, a 20-year-old Seventh-day Adventist graduate student, he wanted to know more about her church and its health teachings. Eventually he received Counsels on Diet and Foods at his request. This book, a compilation of Ellen White materials on a healthful diet and its relation to physical, mental, and spiritual health, also dates and lists the source of the various extracts. Since McCay believed that anything written before 1900 was unscientific, he urgently asked Helen: ―Where did she [Ellen White] get her information?‖ mdxvi186 Later, Dr. McCay talked to F. D. Nichol, editor of the Review and Herald, about his new interest in Adventist health principles as set forth by Ellen White. Nichol, knowing that the Unitarian scientist probably would not understand the Biblical doctrine of spiritual gifts, parried his questions about Ellen White. He told McCay that her critics dismissed her as a plagiarist, copying from contemporaries. ―Nonsense!‖ McCay responded. ―I simply cannot accept that explanation: it creates a much bigger problem than it resolves! If she merely copied her contemporaries, how did she know which ideas to borrow and which to reject, out of the bewildering array of theories and health teachings current in the 19th century? Most were quite irrational and have now been repudiated! She would have had to be a most amazing person, with knowledge beyond her times, in order to do this successfully.‖ mdxvii187
In the years following, McCay gave lectures featuring Ellen White‘s writings on nutrition to various groups, including scientific bodies. A summation of his findings was published in the Review and Herald. mdxviii1881517 U. S. Department of Agriculture and Health, Education, and Welfare. In July 1980, USDA and HEW issued jointly their ―Dietary Guidelines for Americans‖: (1) Eat a variety of foods. (2) Maintain ideal weight. (3) Avoid too much fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol. (4) Eat foods with adequate starch and fiber. (5) Avoid too much sugar. (6) Avoid too much sodium. (7) If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. mdxix189 This report served as a ringing wakeup call to health workers as it was to the general population. But if this report had been issued in 1863, it would have been as startling as Ellen White‘s instructions were at that time! In 1995 the same offices issued their updated ―Dietary Guidelines,‖ emphasizing that ―vegetarian diets are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and can meet Recommended Dietary Allowances for nutrients. mdxx190 This 1995 update placed greater emphasis on the plant foods consistent with the Food Guide Pyramid. ―The revised guideline also acknowledges that grains are associated with ‗a substantially lowered risk of many chronic diseases, including certain types of cancer,‘ that antioxidant nutrients have a ‗potentially beneficial role in reducing the risk of cancer and certain other chronic diseases,‘ and that folate ‗reduces the risk of a serious type of birth defect.‘‖ Further, the revised guideline emphasized that foods, not the salt shaker, are the source of most dietary sodium, continuing to note ―the link between sodium and hypertension‖ and that sodium ―is an essential nutrient substantially overconsumed by the American public in general.‖ mdxxi191 National Academy of Sciences (National Research Council). This research-oriented body gave a joint report in June 1982, entitled ―Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer.‖ Focusing on the connection between diet and cancer, this report was essentially the same as the government report of 1980. Their research indicated that by making
335 changes in one‘s diet, cancer risk can be greatly reduced. Specifically they urged eating largely of fruits, whole grains, and vegetables, and reducing consumption of fats, sugar, salt, and alcohol. mdxxii192 American Cancer Society. In February 1983 the editor of the Society‘s journal, Cancer News, published an article entitled, ―At Last, An Anti-Cancer Diet.‖ The first paragraph pointed to California Seventh-day Adventists as having a much lower rate of colon/rectal cancer than other Americans. Later in the article, studies were noted that indicated breast, colon, and prostate cancer ―is significantly lower among people who eat lots of vegetables. This ‗startling finding,‘ says Walter Troll, professor of environmental medicine at New York University, suggests that vegetables contain substances ‗capable of inhibiting cancer in man.‘‖ mdxxiii193 Surgeon General of the U.S.A. In July 1988 C. Everett Koop, M.D., released the first nutrition report by a U. S. Surgeon General. Based on more than 2,500 scientific articles, his prescription for America was: ―Less fat, more vegetables and fruit.‖ mdxxiv194 Preventive Medicine Research Institute at the School of Medicine, University of California. In 1990 Dean Ornish, president of this research institute at the University of California, published his findings that arterial blockage built up by cholesterol can be reversed by a largely vegetarian diet plus exercise and stress reduction. His conclusions were backed up by four-color slides of computer-analyzed coronary angiograms and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scans. After a dramatic study of 6,500 persons at Cornell University in 1990, Ornish wrote a parody on the slogan used by the American Beef Association: ―Meat. Real food for real death [of people].‖ mdxxv195 Authority on high blood pressure. Norman M. Kaplan, professor of internal medicine and head of the hypertension section of the Southwestern Medical School (University of Texas) in Dallas, speaking at Loma Linda University to more than 1,000 healthcare professionals, said: ―You as Adventists may have espoused a certain dietary lifestyle on the basis of faith, in the past; but now you can practice it on the basis of scientific evidence. Hopefully you will not [go back and re-] join the midstream, but [rather] adhere to your health heritage.‖ mdxxvi196
Adventist Mortality Study, 1958, and a joint study with the American Cancer Society, 1960. These California studies compared the cause of death for a large group of Seventh-day Adventist men with a similar number of non-Seventh-day Adventist men. The research does not differentiate between Adventists who eat meat daily, weekly, monthly, or none at all. Neither does it distinguish between lacto-ovo-vegetarians and total vegetarians. Compared with non-Seventh-day Adventist men, Adventist men can expect fewer deaths caused by some form of cancer. For example, according to the results of the Mortality Study listed below, Adventist men have 20 percent fewer deaths caused by lung cancer compared to the general population‘s death rate from lung cancer. Note the percent of fewer deaths expected among all Adventists for other kinds of cancer: 20 percent, lung cancer 5 percent, mouth, throat, and larynx cancer 32 percent, bronchitis and emphysema 28 percent, bladder cancer 34 percent, esophageal cancer 13 percent, cirrhosis of the liver 72 percent, breast cancer 65 percent, digestive tract cancer 62 percent, leukemia 61 percent, ovarian cancer 54 percent, uterine cancer 66 percent, other cancer 53 percent, strokes 55 percent, diabetes 42 percent, peptic ulcer 31 percent, suicides 59 percent, deaths attributed to all
336 medical causes. mdxxvii197 The Adventist Incidence Study in 1974. Sent to 63,350 Adventist households in California, this questionnaire enumerated ―348 variables covering demographic, socioeconomic, and religious belief and practice characteristics; family and personal medical histories; and nutritional, drug use, and exercise patterns.‖ mdxxviii198 The results continue to bear out the positive health benefits of the Adventist health message set forth by Ellen White a century ago. mdxxix199 European studies confirm these two Adventist studies. A Norwegian seventeen-year study covering all Adventists in that country concluded in 1981 that Norwegian Adventists enjoyed about the same benefits as California Adventists. The study confirmed the observation ―that neither social groups nor geographic selection explains the health advantage observed among Norwegian Seventh-day Adventists‖ and that ―the total life style generally advocated and followed by Seventh-day Adventists explains the observed results.‖ mdxxx200 In 1982 Denmark‘s Cancer Registration Office in Copenhagen reported, after a thirty-five-year study, that only one in ten Adventists developed cancer, whereas the rate for the Danish population was one in four during the same period. The Cancer Registration‘s chief medical director said ―that, without doubt, the Adventists studied in the investigation sustained far less risk of developing cancer than the average person. Their risk was 70 to 80 percent less than that of the general Danish population.‖ mdxxxi201 In 1983 a Dutch study reported an 8.9-year life expectancy advantage for Adventist men and a 3.7-year advantage for Adventist women. mdxxxii202 A Polish study reported in 1985 that Adventist men had an advantage of 9.5 years, and Adventist women a difference of 4.5 years. mdxxxiii203 American Cancer Society Guidelines on Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer Prevention, 1996. Their four basic guidelines were:
1. Choose most of the foods you eat from plant sources. Eat five or more servings of fruit and vegetables each day. Eat other foods from plant sources, such as breads, cereals, grain products, rice, pasta, or beans several times each day. 2. Limit your intake of high-fat foods, particularly from animal sources. Choose foods low in fat. Limit consumption of meats, especially high-fat meats. 3. Be physically active: Achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Be at least moderately active for 30 minutes or more on most days of the week. Stay within your healthy weight range. 4. Limit consumption of alcoholic beverages, if you drink at all. mdxxxiv204
Summary of Ellen White’s Principles of Health Reform Ellen White‘s contribution to an advanced understanding of health and disease may be attributed to these factors: 1. Insights received through visions; 2. Her Spirit-directed ability to perceive what was in harmony with those insights from the maze of current opinion, and 3. Her governing principle of the Great Controversy Theme that placed health matters within the context of a person‘s spiritual motivation, commitment, and preparation for the Advent. The record stands: Compared to the relatively few ―health reformers‖ in her day, Ellen White was unique. When compared to or contrasted with conventional medical wisdom and practice, she was decades ahead of her time. In what way was Ellen White unique? Contemporary health reformers were prescient in some areas, but gravely wrong in others. Many held extreme positions on ―discarding milk, sugar, and salt,‖ etc. mdxxxv205 Others believed that rest, not physical exercise, was indicated for those recuperating from illness. mdxxxvi206 What if Ellen White had held these and other extreme positions? Her credibility would have been severely damaged in the ensuing years. More than that, if
338 she had endorsed contemporary medical knowledge, her credibility would have been demolished. Further, her appeal that she was directed by divine guidance eventually would have been seen as a temporary ploy for self-serving purposes. mdxxxvii207 But the health principles found in her nineteenth-century writings, distinctively coherent, have stood the test of time. Her principles relating to disease prevention as well as health restoration are not today viewed as fads. They were not the result of a ―shotgun‖ approach. mdxxxviii208 All of the principles are integrally related; specifics are seen relating to the whole person‘s total health. The lifestyle of Seventh-day Adventists ―is reflected in the phenomenal accumulation of published research papers concerning the Adventist lifestyle. . . . It seems probable that no other religious group has attracted so much recent interest from scientists.‖ mdxxxix209
Chapter 29—Education-Part1: Principles and Philosophy. Ellen White‟s “able articulation of the role of Christian education as a prime vehicle for the transmission of religious values and purpose constitutes a profound theology of Christian education.” mdxl1 Ellen G. White was recognized as the ―prophetic thought leader of Adventist education from its inception until her death in 1915. . . . It is impossible to comprehend Adventist education either currently or historically without understanding the role and impact of Ellen White upon its development. She was not only a central figure in its development, but she was the only Adventist leader who was in constant prominence from its beginnings up through the end of its formative period (about 1910).‖ mdxli2
Nowhere in the writings of Ellen White do we find the principles of the Great Controversy Theme more explicitly unfolded than in her writings on educational principles. Her understanding of redemption as ―restoration‖ lies at the heart of her educational philosophy. mdxlii3 These educational principles were developed, on one hand, within the context of nineteenth century attempts to reform education, and, on the other, within the denominational context of ―comparative indifference to education reform.‖ mdxliii4 Voices that attempted to reform educational systems in the nineteenth century sounded like lonely cries in the wilderness. The nineteenth century was a transition era from centuries of traditional thinking. In almost every area of American life—including theology, philosophy, medicine, industrialization, and education—the nineteenth century was in ferment. In education, the struggle focused on the old wineskins of classical education that focused on the words (ancient languages) and ideas (philosophies) of Western civilization. mdxliv5 The educated person, as a common denominator, was expected to read and discuss the ancient poets and philosophers in Greek and Latin. However, the question was being asked: With the emergence of democratic ideas, more leisure time, and changing work conditions and expectations, was this elitist, bookish education meeting the needs of ―modern‖ times? John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Heinrich Pestalozzi, and others had been saying ―no‖ for several centuries, but their efforts made little ―dent‖ in traditional education. mdxlv6 However, two influences in the nineteenth century were significant and made some impact on Adventist educational reform. Horace Mann (1796-1859) was perhaps the leader in establishing the need for the public school elementary system in the United States. mdxlvi7 He also wrote extensively on the early need for children to understand physiology and to get a practical education. mdxlvii8 The other major influence centered in educational experiments with manual
345 labor coupled with the emphasis on Biblical instruction rather than the traditional classics at certain academic institutions. Oberlin College (Ohio), the best known of these centers, promoted the Bible as ―a textbook in all the departments of education,‖ integrated a manual labor program for all students, required physiology, and fostered a campus environment of non-competition in areas usually associated with prizes and honors. Its president/founder announced: ―The system of education in this Institute will provide for the body and heart as well as the intellect: for it aims at the best education of the whole man.‖ But by the late 1850s these remarkable educational reforms had lost their initial enthusiasm and their programs soon conformed to the prevailing pattern of other American colleges. mdxlviii9 Though Oberlin faded as a reforming institution, probably because it did not maintain a compelling spiritual context, other voices arose that emphasized a more practical education (progressive education) in unseating the classics with more ―useful‖ subjects and in promoting manual education. The president of Johns Hopkins University in 1888 declared that manual training not only improved physical health but also ―increased mental vigor.‖ mdxlix10 But these voices were not mainstream. The similarity between Ellen White‘s educational reform message and that of a few, clear voices of her time rests on the obvious fact that all those involved in educational reform were contending with the same problems: classic curricula rather than a more practical education; poorly ventilated, poorly lighted classrooms; direct relationship between manual training/exercise with mental vigor, even spiritual values; and education as an important factor in character development. Especially when Bible-oriented reformers attempted educational reform, one would expect general agreement on principles and practice. Ellen White understood this when in her book Education she wrote this remarkable summation of educational principles: ―We can trace the line of the world‘s teachers as far back as human records extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the stars of our solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun, so, as far as their teaching is true, do the world‘s great thinkers reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Every gleam of thought, every flash of the intellect, is from the Light of the world.‖ mdl11
Is there anything unique about Ellen White‘s principles of education? Her special contribution lies in the unity and clarity of her educational philosophy, unencumbered with the fads and ―false leads‖ of
nineteenth century contemporaries. mdli12 Although a few contemporaries also saw the religious purpose of education, Mrs. White placed education within the Great Controversy Theme, including its vital role in eschatology (the study of last-day events). Originality is not the test of a prophet; dynamic freshness, coherence and unity that harmonize with the Bible are. mdlii13 Educational Principles • “Fatal errors” of prevailing educational philosophies focus either on intellectual attainment, temporal success, or even correct behavior, hoping to “develop the good that exists in man by nature.” mdliii14 Ellen White drove past these flattering, self-serving purposes of education with the simple clarity that ―redemption . . . is the object of education.‖ mdliv15 Not wanting to leave this definition in an undefinable generality, she explained the Biblical framework for connecting education with redemption (note the four cornerstones): ―In order to understand what is comprehended in the work of education, we need to consider both the nature of man and the purpose of God in creating him. We need to consider also the change in man‘s condition through the coming in of a knowledge of evil, and God‘s plan for still fulfilling His glorious
346 purpose in the education of the human race.‖ mdlv16 This educational strategy can be understood only within the framework of the Great Controversy Theme. • First and constant aim of Christian education. Thus, for Christian teachers on whatever level, their ―first effort and . . . constant aim‖ should be (1) to aid ―the student in comprehending these principles,‖ and (2) to enter ―into that relation with Christ which will make [these principles] a controlling power in the life.‖ mdlvi17 Ellen White reiterated often that the ―all-important thing‖ in education ―should be the conversion‖ of students. mdlvii18 ―It is upon the foundation of the new birth experience that Christian education can proceed with its other aims and purposes. If it fails at the foundational and primary point, it has failed entirely.‖ mdlviii19 • Fundamental aim sets agenda. This fundamental aim of education—to restore the broken relationship between God and the student—sets the educational agenda and curriculum. All the other purposes of education are enlightened and molded by this primary purpose. Christian teachers know that character education (not personality change in order to add to one‘s self-esteem or to assist in climbing the career ladder) seeks ―to restore the image of Christ in those placed under their care.‖ mdlix20 • Towering motivation for reaching one‟s full potential. The Great Controversy Theme leaves its mark on all phases of the Christian‘s life. ―Restoration‖ is its key thought. The full development of all human capabilities is the goal before every Christian. The Energy of heaven is promised to those who permit the heavenly current to flow. But that Energy flows only in the direction of loving service. That is why Ellen White wrote that astounding sentence: ―The development of all our powers is the first duty we owe to God and to our fellow men.‖ mdlx21 Self-development, yes. But not to become Number One! The pursuit of excellence? Yes! ―We should cultivate every faculty to the highest degree of perfection, that we may do the greatest amount of good of which we are capable. . . . God will accept only those who are determined to aim high. . . . And those who would be workers together with God must strive for perfection of every organ of the body and quality of the mind. True education is the preparation of the physical, mental, and moral powers for the performance of every duty; it is the training of body, mind, and soul for divine service.‖ mdlxi22 • The pursuit of intellectual greatness if. . . . Students are challenged ―to reach to the highest point of intellectual greatness . . . if balanced by religious principle.‖ mdlxii23 ―Dullness and ignorance are no virtue.‖ mdlxiii24 ―The highest culture of the mind, if sanctified through the love and the fear of God, receives His fullest approval.‖ mdlxiv25 ―All who engage in the acquisition of knowledge should strive to reach the highest round of the ladder. Let students advance as fast and as far as they can; let the field of their study be as broad as their powers can compass; but let them make God their wisdom.‖ mdlxv26
• Occupational skills imperative. Further, each student is to join intellectual pursuits with ―a knowledge of some trade or occupation by which, if need be, he may earn a livelihood.‖ mdlxvi27 Learning an occupational skill was urged not merely to be prepared to earn a living if circumstances required such, but also to add vigor to mental studies mdlxvii28 and to provide a special opportunity for character growth. Learning a trade would help produce ―a more elevated class of youth . . . with stability of character. They would have perseverance, fortitude, and courage to surmount obstacles.‖ In fact, if students had to make a choice between a knowledge of the sciences or a ―knowledge of labor for practical life,‖ Mrs. White would ―unhesitatingly answer, The latter. If one must be neglected, let it be the study of books.‖ mdlxviii29
347 • School curriculum must be organized to fulfill education‟s highest aim. The contrast between secular and Bible-centered curricula is seen most clearly in how the nature of human beings is perceived. Are we products of an evolutionary ascent, or are we created beings, made in the image of our Creator? Is education a matter of ―getting ahead‖ and ―succeeding‖ in a secular career, or is it a process of allowing our Creator to work out His original plan for human beings? Ellen White‘s many references to making the Bible ―a textbook in our schools‖ meant that the Bible should be the ―basis of all education.‖ The Bible should not be inserted into the curriculum ―sandwiched in between infidelity,‖ to merely ―flavor‖ other studies. mdlxix30 Further, making the Bible ―the basis of education‖ does not mean that it is to be the only textbook for classes such as arithmetic, languages, and geography. The Bible was not given to the human family to be its best encyclopedia, but it does give a worldview that helps to interpret and apply information. Ellen White noted that all academic disciplines, every area of thought, take on ―new significance‖ when seen in the light of the Great Controversy Theme. She meant that all classes must be taught within the framework of the Biblical worldview, that every class should reflect the grand purpose of Christian education—―to restore in man the image of his Maker.‖ mdlxx31 • Essential courses of study. In addition to her emphasis on the Biblical context for all classes, mdlxxi32 Ellen White asserted that physiology should be ―the first study‖ in the educational program in order ―to preserve health.‖ mdlxxii33 Vocal training would greatly increase the usefulness of every student. Speaking to both men and women, Ellen White wrote: ―However imperfect may be your manner of utterance, you may correct your faults, and refuse to allow yourself to have a nasal tone, or to speak in a thick, indistinct way. If your articulation is distinct and intelligible, your usefulness will be greatly increased. Then do not leave one defective habit of speech uncorrected.‖ mdlxxiii34 • Role of the parents as educators. Educational psychologists and sociologists are alarmed at what many call the most critical issue facing modern civilization—the disintegration of the family. mdlxxiv35 Ellen White wrote much about the influence of the home for good or ill in the education of children. Neither parent should shift the responsibilities of educating the children to the other: ―Only by working in unison, can the father and mother accomplish the work which God has committed to their hands.‖ mdlxxv36 But the mother has a unique role: ―No other work can equal hers in importance.‖ mdlxxvi37 A surrogate mother is a poor substitute for a biological mother who pursues other goals. mdlxxvii38 Why does the responsibility of educating children rest so heavily on parents, especially the mother? Why cannot outside-the-home services such as day-care centers and early kindergartens take the place of parents? Because ―lessons learned, the habits formed, during the years of infancy and childhood, have more to do with the formation of character and the direction of the life than have all the instruction and training of after years.‖ mdlxxviii39 In fact, Mrs. White wrote: ―The first six or seven years of a child‘s life‖ should be ―given to its physical training, rather than the intellect. . . . Parents, especially mothers, should be the only teachers of such infant minds.‖ mdlxxix40 However, circumstances may require earlier schooling, as Ellen White made clear at St. Helena, California, in 1904. mdlxxx41
One of the startling misconceptions of modern times is that children need parents less after they start school, even after becoming adolescents. mdlxxxi42 • Higher education more than information. When Ellen White spoke of ―higher education‖ she meant more than
348 schooling beyond the twelfth grade. In fact, ―higher education‖ had more to do with a religious experience than with advanced information: ―Higher education calls for something greater, something more divine, than the knowledge to be obtained merely from books. It means a personal, experimental knowledge of Christ; it means emancipation from ideas, from habits and practices, that have been gained in the school of the prince of darkness.‖ mdlxxxii43 Mrs. White often emphasized that one should excel in literary and science studies but must not accomplish this to the neglect of religious experience. She wrote: ―An intellectual religion will not satisfy the soul. Intellectual training must not be neglected, but it is not sufficient. Students must be taught that they are in this world to do service for God. They must be taught to place the will on the side of God‘s will.‖ mdlxxxiii44 To her, both strict intellectualism, even theological understanding, without Christian commitment, are to be avoided. One of her frequent themes was that ―ignorance will not increase the humility or spirituality of any professed follower of Christ.‖ Further, ―the truths of the divine word can be best appreciated by an intellectual Christian. Christ can be best glorified by those who serve Him intelligently. The great object of education is to enable us to use the powers which God has given us in such a manner as will best represent the religion of the Bible and promote the glory of God.‖ mdlxxxiv45 • Teacher credibility. Mrs. White called for teachers who are able to bridge the gap between religion and theology, between experience and knowledge: ―The teacher of truth can impart effectively only that which he himself knows by experience.‖ mdlxxxv46 In fact, the teacher‘s personal habits and spiritual experience should be ―considered of even greater importance than his literary qualifications.‖ mdlxxxvi47 • Recreation as necessary as study and labor. A frequent theme in Ellen White‘s writings is her call for balance and moderation in most any activity of the Christian. For some who have heard only her call to diligence and perseverance in pursuing excellence, her emphasis on recreation may come as a shock. She wrote early in her ministry: ―Recreation is needful to those who are engaged in physical labor, and is still more essential for those whose labor is principally mental. It is not essential to our salvation, nor for the glory of God, to keep the mind laboring constantly and excessively, even upon religious themes.‖ mdlxxxvii48 Mrs. White used the word ―recreation‖ in its best sense. She focused on the ―recreating‖ purpose of withdrawing from the busy program of either mental or physical activity. She suggested, for example, that several families unite and ―make an excursion into the country‖ with tasty and wholesome food in their baskets. What would these families do? She continued: ―Parents and children should feel free from care, labor, and perplexity. Parents should become children with their children, making everything as pleasant for them as possible. Let the whole day be given to recreation.‖ mdlxxxviii49 But, for Ellen White recreation was not to be a spiritual vacation from Christian commitment. In her landmark book on education, Education, she devoted a chapter to ―Recreation.‖ In that chapter she differentiated between recreation and amusement: ―Recreation, when true to its name, re-creation, tends to strengthen and build up. Calling us aside from our ordinary cares and occupations, it affords refreshment for mind and body, and thus enables us to return with new vigor to the earnest work of life. Amusement, on the other hand, is sought for the sake of pleasure, and is often carried to excess; it absorbs the energies that are required for useful work, and thus proves a hindrance to life‘s true success.‖ mdlxxxix50
349
Compared to the pace of life in the nineteenth century, modern families live under much greater stress. One of the paradoxes is that today‘s families, though having more ―labor-saving devices,‖ also live more tension-filled, schedule-driven lives than their forebears. Furthermore, very few professions
in the Western world require physical activity. The need for recreation today is substantial, not only to ―take the mind off‖ the business at hand but to provide the physical exercise that good health requires. In other words, no people in history have ever needed planned recreation more. At the same time, perhaps no other people in history have ever been confronted with so much pseudo-recreation in the form of spectator sports, passive entertainment, and sedentary amusements. Ellen White laid out clear principles regarding recreation: Students must have vigorous exercise, but it should be done, whenever possible, in the open air. Sports of violence, as well as athletic games carried to excess, in addition to promoting the ―love of domination [and] the pride in mere brute force . . . stimulate the love of pleasure and excitement, thus fostering a distaste for useful labor, a disposition to shun practical duties and responsibilities.‖ Parents and teachers ―can do much to supply diversions wholesome and life-giving‖ instead of ―frivolous associations, habits of extravagance, or pleasure-seeking.‖ The highest form of recreation, filled with blessings to students, are those activities ―which make them helpful to others.‖ ―The preoccupation of the mind with good is worth more than unnumbered barriers of law and discipline.‖ mdxc51 Train Students to Be Thinkers, Not Mere Reflectors Thinkers do more than accept passively the thinking of others; they endeavor to master what others have said or discovered. Thinkers ―contemplate the great facts of duty and destiny‖: they are ―masters and not slaves of circumstances [possessing] breadth of mind, clearness of thought, and the courage of their convictions.‖ mdxci52 How does one fulfill this lofty goal? Ellen White expressed certain principles that ―thinkers‖ should understand: Thinkers understand the perils of competition. Why one wants to excel is the defining question. One of her constant themes is the call to excellence, to reach the highest level possible in whatever field of study or lifework one is engaged. mdxcii53 But a core problem of prevailing educational systems is that it urges excellence for the wrong reasons and its attainment by the wrong methods. Mrs. White asked the question, ―What is the trend of the education given?‖ Then she answered, ―To self-seeking.‖ She described the goals of ―true education‖ as the antithesis of ―selfish ambition, the greed for power, and . . . selfish rivalry.‖ She observed that traditional educational methods ―appeal to emulation and rivalry . . . [and] foster selfishness, the root of all evil.‖ mdxciii54 ―Strife for supremacy‖ encourages ―the system of ‗cramming‘‖ and often ―leads to dishonesty.‖ By driving students to compete, ―discontent . . . embitters the life‖ and ―helps to fill the world with . . . restless, turbulent spirits.‖ mdxciv55 What feeds this spirit of rivalry and the desire for supremacy? Ellen White pointed to the content of much literature: Students ―drink . . . from the wells of paganism . . . fed by the corruptions of ancient heathendom. . . . And of how many modern authors also might the same be said!‖ In the sciences she saw the effects of ―evolution and its kindred errors‖ that tend ―to infidelity.‖ Further, she saw that the ―work of ‗higher criticism‘ . . . is destroying faith in the Bible as a divine revelation . . . robbing God‘s word of power to control, uplift, and inspire human lives.‖
350 Ellen White saw that when ―youth go out into the world‖ motivated by the assumptions of non-Biblical thought, they have no barriers to meet the prevailing sentiments that ―desire is the highest law, that license is liberty, and that man is accountable only to himself.‖ Youth catch the spirit of society flawed by rivalry and competition and, unless made aware of the price of competition, they have no safeguards to maintain ―individual integrity. . . purity of the home, the well-being of society, or the stability of the nation.‖ mdxcv56
For Ellen White a world of difference separates excellence and competition. This distinction rests on the purpose of education: to ―restore the image of God in the soul.‖ mdxcvi57 Men and women are to ―reach the highest possible degree of excellence,‖ but this goal cannot be reached by a ―selfish and exclusive culture; for the character of God, whose likeness we are to receive, is benevolence and love.‖ mdxcvii58 To reach the Biblical goal of education, Mrs. White observed, would require a ―radical change in some of the current methods of education. Instead of appealing to pride and selfish ambition, kindling a spirit of emulation, teachers would endeavor to awaken the love of goodness and truth and beauty—to arouse the desire for excellence. The student would seek the development of God‘s gifts in himself, not to excel others, but to fulfill the purpose of the Creator and to receive His likeness.‖ mdxcviii59 The inherent flaw in using the spirit of competition to motivate students in the classroom or on the playing field, (or to arouse pastors to reach certain goals and congregations to raise funds, etc.) is that competition is not a principle of God‘s kingdom of love—cooperation is. mdxcix60 To fulfill the purpose of education, to restore in men and women the image of their Maker, ―the temptation to be first would be quenched in the lessons daily learned in the school of Christ.‖ mdc61 Modern educational psychologists have recognized that competition is not a valid motivator. They point out three basic flaws. Flaw One: That young people need competitive experiences in order to enter a competitive society. Flaw Two: That competition is an effective motivator. Granted, they say, competition is ―valuable as a motivator only for those people who believe that they can win.‖ But those who do not believe that they can win are not so motivated; they are further ―discouraged and disillusioned.‖ Flaw Three: The stress on competition leads to morality breakdown and to the compelling rule that the end justifies the means. mdci62 Thinkers (both students and teachers) have learned that mere memorization is insufficient. Thinking is a learned event. Learning to think is a joint effort by thinking teachers and eager students. Ellen White urged Bible teachers especially ―to make the students understand their lessons, not by explaining everything to them, but by requiring them to explain clearly every passage they read. Let these teachers remember that little good is accomplished by skimming over the surface.‖ mdcii63 Dynamic discussion with students repeating the teacher‘s explanations ―in their own language‖ so that it can be determined that ―they clearly comprehend‖ their lessons may be ―a slow process,‖ but it is of ―ten times more value than rushing over important subjects.‖ Not only will students better understand the subject, they will be better prepared to explain the material to others. mdciii64 Thinkers will appreciate a “moral taste in love of work.” To modern minds, this hardly seems to be a factor in developing thinkers, but it lies close to the root of Ellen White‘s philosophy of education. In the establishment of the Avondale school in the late 1890s, she urged a principle that she had been emphasizing for at least twenty years—that students must be educated to be masters of labor, and not
351 slaves of labor. She wanted students to see the ―science in the humblest kind of work,‖ to see ―nobility in labor.‖ As we have shown on page 346, ―manual occupation . . . is essential‖ in order to balance and strengthen mental activity. Minds are ―abused‖ when the physical powers are not ―equally taxed.‖ Further, ―habits of industry will be . . . an important aid to the youth in resisting temptation.‖ ―Pent-up energies . . . if not expended in useful employment, will be a continual source of trial to themselves, and to their teachers.‖ For these reasons, Ellen White declared that those whose goal is to obtain a ―transformed mind and character‖ will develop ―a new moral taste in love of work.‖ mdciv65
Thinkers understand that perseverance and commitment are the price of excellence. To excel in any line of work requires an eye not easily distracted by ―the voice of pleasure‖ and other diversions. Ellen White pleaded with parents and teachers to instruct young people that good intentions ―will not avail,‖ that ―no excellence is gained without great labor.‖ Furthermore, no great achievement is
reached quickly or by ignoring ―present opportunities.‖ Those who reach the ―height in moral and intellectual attainments . . . must possess a brave and resolute spirit.‖ mdcv66
Chapter 30—Education-Part 2: Establishing Educational Institutions “The truths of the divine word can be best appreciated by an intellectual Christian. Christ can be best glorified by those who serve Him intelligently.” mdcvi1 Battle Creek College. A Battle Creek school for Adventist youth, locally supported, had been successfully conducted by G. H. Bell beginning in 1868. In April 1872 James and Ellen White called for an upgrading of this school into an advanced educational facility, the first attempt to have a school supported by the denomination. The primary purpose of this proposal was to educate teachers and preachers ―to proclaim the third angel‘s message.‖ mdcvii2 As guidance for this school, Mrs. White wrote Testimony for the Church, No. 22, entitled, ―Proper Education.‖ mdcviii3 This document has been studied for more than a century by Adventist educators as a clear charter for Adventist education. Here she developed one of her fundamental principles of Christian education: the correlation between ―the physical, mental, moral, and religious‖ aspects of education. mdcix4 The early years of Battle Creek College were turbulent. The principles of this 1872 testimony may have been understood in theory but neither administrators nor teachers seemed to know how to implement certain of the key themes. Among these were how to include a manual labor program in the school curriculum, how to make the curriculum Bible-oriented and not merely include Bible as an elective subject, and how to frame the curriculum with practical subjects, eliminating the classics as the main thrust. mdcx5 This false start led Ellen White to address the denominational leaders in December 1881. She opened her remarks with a clear message of concern: ―There is danger that our college will be turned away from its original design.‖ Later she warned: ―Our college stands today in a position that God does not approve.‖ She noted the ―effort to mold our school after other colleges. When this is done, we can give no encouragement to parents to send their children to Battle Creek College.‖ To teach students only a knowledge of books could be done at any college. ―A more comprehensive education is needed‖ that would include emphasis on character development, a daily reminder to give students a ―sense of their obligation to God,‖ and a program to ―unite physical with mental taxation.‖ Mrs. White went on to spotlight the importance of right motivation in the work of both teachers and students: ―The evils of self-esteem, and an unsanctified independence, which most impair our usefulness, and which will prove our ruin, if not overcome, spring from selfishness.‖ mdcxi6 Dark days came when the college closed on August 10, 1882. Problems included personnel clashes as well as the
355 perceived crisis that the young college had not met the purposes for which it had been established. One year later it was reopened with the clear statement that the college would ―in all respects‖ harmonize with the instruction provided through the Spirit of prophecy. mdcxii7 However, again it was easier to publish the school‘s goals than to implement them. The turning point in the development of Adventist education came at the Harbor Springs, Michigan, educational convention in the summer of 1891. Ellen White made at least six presentations in addition to rereading her 1872 testimony on ―Proper Education.‖ She renewed her previous emphasis on eliminating from the curriculum pagan and infidel authors and the courses in Latin and Greek classics. In addition, her emphasis on Bible teaching and history from the standpoint of prophecy as well as the spiritual qualifications of teachers seemed to take hold among the leading educators.
After the Harbor Springs educational conference, Mrs. White wrote six articles in the church paper reinforcing the strong positions she had taken at the conference. The battle of the curriculum was changing in her favor but it did not come immediately. The knife edge of educational reform was the
defining difference between conventional classical education and the perspective of Christian education in the light of the Great Controversy Theme. mdcxiii8 Healdsburg College/Pacific Union College In 1881 the California Conference recognized the need for a west coast college. By April 1882 property was purchased in Healdsburg with Sidney Brownsberger, former president of Battle Creek College, as its first president. The school did not become financially secure, largely because of low charges to students. Ellen White counseled schools against attempting to attract higher enrollment by lowering fees, because of the ―detrimental‖ effect this would have. mdcxiv9 Mrs. White‘s involvement in acquiring the Angwin, California, property when the Healdsburg site proved to be inadequate revealed again how human effort plus divine affirmation leads to sound decisions. The circumstances that led from one possible location to another provide a textbook lesson on divine guidance. Ellen White wrote of the experience: ―Now this lesson given us at this time of our great necessity was one of the most remarkable adventures in our experience.‖ mdcxv10 Avondale College When Ellen White went to Australia in 1891, little did anyone foresee how great the impact of its new institution of higher learning would have on the denomination‘s worldwide educational philosophy. No other Adventist school has been more favored by the presence and counsel of God‘s messenger to the church. Behind her were the struggling American schools, wobbling into the future trying to combine conventional education principles with the reforming principles of education driven by the Great Controversy Theme. mdcxvi11 Early in 1894 Mrs. White wrote the mandate for the new Australian school, entitled ―Work and Education.‖ mdcxvii12 In the opening paragraph she raised the central questions regarding this and other schools: ―How shall they be conducted? What shall be the education and training of the youth? Where shall our Australian Bible School be located?‖ Then she proceeded to answer her questions. She reemphasized that the purpose of Christian education is to prepare students to meet the Lord. This kind of aim means students must rethink their recreational activities, that the school must be located ―a wide distance from the cities,‖ that useful work must be a part of the curriculum, that only the best work-habits are acceptable, that ―dullness and ignorance are no virtue,‖ that for Australia ―there is hope in the soil,‖ and that physiology must be in the curriculum for all. mdcxviii13
356 Ellen White was learning through experience as well as through visions. In 1898 she wrote that Adventist education must include ―a different order of things,‖ but that ―it has taken much time to understand what changes should be made.‖ mdcxix14 In September of 1898 she wrote that ―our school must be a model school for others.‖ mdcxx15 In 1899 she said that God had designed Avondale to be ―an object lesson‖ and not ―to pattern after any school that has been established in America, or after any school‖ in Australia. mdcxxi16 In 1900 she penned that the Avondale school was ―to be a pattern school.‖ mdcxxii17 Ellen White never used the expression ―educational blueprint.‖ mdcxxiii18 Though using such words as ―model,‖ ―object lesson,‖ and ―pattern,‖ she did not mean that Avondale was to be rigidly copied in every detail: ―The Lord has not designed any one, special, exact plan in education.‖ mdcxxiv19 Regarding the new school at Madison, Tennessee (described below), she wrote that ―no exact pattern can be given for the establishment of schools in new fields. The climate, the surroundings, the condition of the country, and the means at hand with which to work must all bear a part in shaping the work.‖ mdcxxv20 As with her counsel in other areas, such as health, she outlined basic principles, not inflexible rules. mdcxxvi21 Model schools, patterns, and object lessons are just that—they manifest basic principles that may require adaptation to local conditions.
To son Willie in 1897 she emphasized that ―no breezes from Battle Creek are to be wafted in.‖ Living adjacent to the campus, she still felt that she ―must watch before and behind and on every side to permit nothing to find entrance that has been presented before me as injuring our schools in America.‖ mdcxxvii22 Madison College Ellen White had much to do with locating the site for Madison College in 1904. She had been telling her colleagues that the school must be near Nashville, Tennessee. When a 400-acre property in Madison, seventeen miles from Nashville, became available for about $12,000, she asked to see it. Though some were not impressed, she reported that ―it was a favorable location for the work‖ and must be purchased. mdcxxviii23 Madison College was the only institution on which Mrs. White served as a member of the board of directors. She wanted to make sure that the bitter lessons learned at Battle Creek and the new school at Berrien Springs, Michigan, would not be repeated at Madison. One of the clear goals of the founders, Edward A. Sutherland and Percy T. Magan, was that ―the more closely conditions in the school approximated the conditions students would face when they went out to teach, the more easily would they adjust to their vocations.‖ mdcxxix24 Perhaps for the first time, student labor, rather than cash, was accepted for tuition. All the staff and faculty worked with the students in developing industries that would provide income. The vast majority of the student body expected to serve in some capacity in the rural South. By 1915, thirty-nine of these self-supporting schools had been developed by Madison College graduates. mdcxxx25 College of Medical Evangelists/Loma Linda University The establishment of this world-renowned medical institution would never have happened without the vision, courage, and continuing support of Ellen White. Richard Utt well said: ―The rise of Loma Linda University was not so much fraught with the inevitable as with the impossible. That the feat was accomplished at all was due to a rare recipe of faith, works, and struggle, liberally laced with the improbable, the miraculous, and the heroic.‖ mdcxxxi26 In 1905 sunny southern California had two Adventist health centers—one at Paradise Valley, near San Diego, and another at Glendale, near Los Angeles,
357 both of them founded on Ellen White‘s strong insistence and help in finding the initial funding. mdcxxxii27 Though popular, both institutions were deeply in debt. But God was not finished with southern California. Through His promptings, Mrs. White called on John Burden, mdcxxxiii28 the ―founder‖ of the Glendale sanitarium, to look for property near Redlands. Incredible as it sounded to 1,400 church members in the local conference and their leaders who had been warned not to go further into debt, God‘s messenger had spoken again: ―Redlands and Riverside have been presented to me as places that should be worked. . . . Please consider the advisability of establishing a sanitarium in the vicinity of these towns.‖ mdcxxxiv29 The story of the acquisition of the Loma Linda property, the remarkable faith of men like Burden, the sobering witness of funds that would arrive unexpectedly at the very moment needed, of men and women who mortgaged their homes and took out bank loans—all this is a matter of record. mdcxxxv30 In the telling of this extraordinary story, the visible and invisible presence of Ellen White is as pervasive as sunshine at noonday. When all seemed bleak, she would counsel: ―This is the very property that we ought to have. Do not delay; for it is just what is needed.‖ mdcxxxvi31 After seeing the buildings for the first time, she exclaimed: ―I have been here before. . . . This is the place the Lord has shown me. . . . The Lord has not given us this property for any common purpose.‖ mdcxxxvii32
A few weeks later when church leaders manifested little enthusiasm for her counsel, Ellen White wrote to Burden: ―Do not be discouraged if in any wise there is some cutting across of your plans, and if you are somewhat hindered. . . . I have seen the hold-back principles followed, and I have seen the
displeasure of the Lord because of this. If the same spirit is manifested, I shall not consent to keep silent as I have done.‖ mdcxxxviii33 In fact, during conference business meetings that would have a significant bearing on the future of the struggling Loma Linda concept, Ellen White would sit on the platform so that she could hear the intent of each motion and ensuing discussion. She wrote that she was ―old enough to be excused from such burdens‖ but ―she feared that some action might be taken that would in the future bring about confusion.‖ One of the proposed motions sounded innocent enough but her years of experience helped her to see its danger: some wanted to change the constitution so that ―every church member might become a delegate to the conference meetings.‖ She spoke out: ―Read that motion again, if you please.‖ Then she commented, ―Such a motion as that was made years ago, and the matter was distinctly opened before me. . . . The motion has never carried at any time, because it is not in harmony with the mind of the Lord.‖ The resolution was withdrawn. mdcxxxix34 After the land had been purchased, some church members thought that additional funds surely would be needed for developing the school. They urged that a portion of the seventy-six acres be sold for building sites. Immediately Mrs. White gave a resounding No! In fact, she urged the purchase of many more acres, another astounding challenge. With board members with her, she looked off into the valley toward the railroad and Colton Avenue. With a wave of her hand, she said, ―The angel said, ‗Get all of it.‘‖ When others remonstrated, she said, ―Well, we shall be thankful for what we have.‖ But the challenge seemed too much. Three years went by. Most of the land had doubled in price when steps finally were taken to acquire needed property. In 1911 further land became available. Again, there was hesitancy. In her eighty-fourth year Ellen White personally pledged $1,000 toward its purchase, and closed her appeal with these words: ―I am highly gratified as I look upon the land we already have. This will be one of the
358 greatest blessings to us in the future—one that we do not fully appreciate now, but which we shall appreciate by and by. I hope that you will get the other land that I have spoken of, and join it to that which you already have. It will pay you to do this. As I have carried the burden of this place from the very beginning, I wanted to say this much to you. Now I leave the matter with you; and let us work in harmony.‖ In a few days several board members took out personal bank loans to secure the property. Ellen White was delighted, writing to Burden that ―the piece of land we must have, for it will never do to have buildings crowded in there. Do not fail to carry through the purchase of it. Do your best, and I will do my best.‖ mdcxl35 But she was also interested in the kind of institution to be established at Loma Linda. It should be more than a sanitarium. Earlier in 1905, she wrote: ―This place will become an important educational center.‖ mdcxli36 This was a new and lofty goal for Loma Linda—a school too! Yet the question remained, what kind of school? A few weeks later she spelled out the new center‘s direction: ―He [God] is opening ways whereby your children can be given an education in medical missionary lines without endangering their souls. . . . In a short time we shall have facilities for giving the necessary requirements.‖ By December 10 she had written: ―In regard to the school, I would say, Make it all you possibly can in the education of nurses and physicians.‖ mdcxlii37 For a denomination to hear this challenge at the time when Battle Creek Sanitarium and the attached American Medical Missionary College was still an open wound, seemed too much. Perhaps a sanitarium at Loma Linda, but a medical school? All that most could think of was the financial burden that for years had over-whelmed Dr. Kellogg and the denomination. But the Lord‘s messenger was courageous and compelling. Those who had learned to trust her in the past proceeded to do what seemed impossible for a small denomination of 91,531 members in 1906. The Lord was leading His people as fast as they were able to grasp what He had in mind for the institution at Loma Linda.
At the General Conference session in Washington, in June 1909, Ellen White addressed the delegates who had barely recovered their breath from the expense of moving two major institutions to the nation‘s capital. Among many topics was Loma Linda‘s destiny ―to be not only a sanitarium, but an educational center,‖ especially for the training of ―gospel medical missionary evangelists,‖ and that it was ―very essential that a right beginning be made.‖ Step By Step Later in her address she showed again that her own mind was being led step by step by the Lord. She declared that ―we should not at this time seek to compete with worldly medical schools. Should we do this, our chances of success would be small. We are not now prepared to carry out successfully the work of establishing large medical institutions of learning. . . . At Loma Linda many can be educated to work as missionaries in the cause of health and temperance. Teachers are to be prepared for many lines of work.‖ mdcxliii38 Here she was painting, with broad strokes, not only a medical school but an educational facility that would prepare young people to meet the opportunities in ―many lines of work.‖ The Lord is very kind, even to prophets; if He had revealed everything to Ellen White in 1905 that He would be helping her to grasp and communicate in 1909, perhaps she would have doubted her own mind and His instruction. As others made plans to develop a medical program for nurses and gospel medical missionary evangelists, they continually consulted her about questions along this untried path.
359 When asked whether medical students should get basic training at Loma Linda and get the ―finishing touches . . . from some worldly institution,‖ Mrs. White replied: ―God forbid that such a plan would be followed.‖ Responding to further questions, she said: ―If the Lord gives you light, well and good, we will be glad to receive it; if not, then we will wait. . . . When we take hold upon God, and trust in Him, He will work in our behalf. But whatever the consequences may be, we are in regard to our faith to stand distinct and separate from the world.‖ mdcxliv39 She had learned well the painful lessons of Battle Creek. Very clear on the purposes of the denomination‘s second medically-oriented school, she told the leaders that students at Loma Linda were to study under ―carefully selected educators‖ who would teach them ―to plow deep into the Word of God.‖ mdcxlv40 In developing a State charter for a medical school, she gave further counsel: ―If you can gain force and influence that will make your work more effective without tying yourselves to worldly men, that would be right. But we are not to exalt the human above the divine.‖ In November 1909 she wrote: ―We cannot submit to regulations if the sacrifice of principles is involved, for this would imperil the soul‘s salvation. But whenever we can comply with the law of the land without putting ourselves in a false position, we should do so. Wise laws have been framed in order to safeguard the people against the imposition of unqualified physicians. These laws we should respect, for we are ourselves protected from presumptuous pretenders. Should we manifest opposition to these requirements, it would tend to restrict the influence of our medical missionaries.‖ On December 9 a State charter was secured authorizing the College of Medical Evangelists to grant degrees in the liberal sciences, dentistry, and medicine. mdcxlvi41 A few months later, perplexities still lingered. The school board faced enormous expenses and needed affirmation from Ellen White before they made any further commitments. Their concerns, addressed to her on January 26, 1910, mdcxlvii42 included these thoughts: ―We are very anxious to preserve unity and harmony of action. In order to do this, we must have a clear understanding of what is to be done. Are we to understand, from what you have written concerning the establishment of a medical school at Loma Linda, that, according to the light you have received from the Lord, we are to establish a thoroughly equipped medical school, the graduates from which will be able to take State board examinations and become registered, qualified physicians?‖ mdcxlviii43
Within twenty-four hours Ellen White responded, in part: ―The light given me is, We must provide that which is essential to qualify our youth who desire to be physicians, so that they may intelligently fit themselves to be able to stand the examinations required to prove their efficiency as physicians.‖ mdcxlix44 At that same meeting it was recommended that all North American unions plus the General Conference participate in sharing the expenses of the embryonic College of Medical Evangelists. This income would be in addition to that from tuition and private donations. Many speeches of renewed confidence followed. I. H. Evans, a vice-president of the General Conference, summed up the unanimous mind of the large committee (this recommendation was voted without dissent): ―When the statement from Sister White is read, I am sure that the majority of our brethren will feel as we feel tonight—that the Lord has spoken, and we will obey. . . . Past experiences should strengthen our faith at this time and help us to move forward courageously in heeding the words of counsel which the Lord has given to us through Sister White. We have before us tonight a plain, straightforward statement from Sister
360 White in regard to the establishment of a medical school. There is no guesswork about it; there is no equivocation; there is no false construction that need be put upon these words. The question is, Will we follow the counsel given?‖ mdcl45 Logical questions remained: Where would Adventists find qualified physicians to be teachers? Where would the enormous funds to operate a first-class medical institution, including nursing, medicine, dietetics, and years later dentistry, be found? But leaders had been learning how to lead as they broke new ground. Ellen White had been leading them into the untried many times before. Here again, as we have seen often in the development of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the principle of divine-human cooperation prevailed. Clearly, God does not plan to do for men and women what they can and should do for themselves. He leads, but people are to trust in His general principles and make their decisions accordingly. That is how believers grow and become prepared for future challenges. It is the parable of the talents operating on a larger scale. When the appointed head of the new school, W. E. Howell, asked Mrs. White for more details so that no mistakes would be made from the start, she replied: ―We cannot mark out a precise line to be followed unconditionally. Circumstances and emergencies will arise for which the Lord must give special instruction. But if we begin to work, depending wholly upon the Lord, watching, praying, and walking in harmony with the light He sends us, we shall not be left to walk in darkness.‖ mdcli46 In 1905 Ellen White‘s final book on health principles, The Ministry of Healing, appeared and was closely studied at Loma Linda. More material on gospel medical work was printed in volumes eight and nine of the Testimonies. In 1932, Medical Ministry, a compilation of many letters to physicians that focused on the divine purpose in health education and practice, was published. Those men and women in 1910 should be paradigms and templates for all Seventh-day Adventists until the end of time. They listened to the messenger of God whom they had learned to trust. They knew that the only question that needed to be answered was I. H. Evans‘s question: ―Will we follow the counsel given?‖ Educational Leaders Learned to Listen to Ellen White When one reviews the first fifty years after Ellen White published her first testimony on ―Proper Education,‖ mdclii47 in 1872, several common characteristics appear: (1) the closer a school followed inspired instruction, the more efficient and productive its program became; (2) the administrators who broke new ground in educational reform believed strongly in the inspiration of Ellen White; (3) when administrators and faculty taught these principles, by precept and example, the student body responded positively.
Whenever school staffs were ambivalent regarding educational reform, students would catch the ambiguity and express their frustration in some unconstructive way. The troublesome experiences of
Battle Creek College would stand forever as an object lesson of the negative consequences of unsureness in responding to inspired counsel. mdcliii48
