## CHAPTER XII   

# INTERPRETATION OF THE   GOSPELS   AND  THE EPISTLES 
George E.  Rice  

## Introduction 

This chapter will  discuss methods of  interpretation that will  help  make  the  Gospels  and  the NT  epistles meaningful.   It is not  our  purpose  to  get  into  the  technical  discussion  of NT  scholars  regarding  these  books,  although reference will  be  made to this discussion  on occasions for purposes of  clarification.   Our  goal  is to help  the  reader to  see  that  careful,  thoughtful,  and prayerful reading  of  the  Gospels and the  Epistles  will  be  rewarded  with  meaningful  insights  and bring spiritual renewal. 

## 1.  Interpreting  the  Gospels  

For  the  moment,  we  are  interested  in the  Gospels  and  how  to  gain  an  understanding   of what  they  are  communicating.  All four  Gospels  report  various  parts of Jesus'  life  and  ministry.  They  do  not  contain  a  complete  report,  of  course,  for  they  are  much  too  short  to  be  what  we  commonly  call  a  biography.    In  fact,  the  apostle  John  concludes  his  gospel  with  the  observation,  "And there  are  also many  other  things  that  Jesus  did, which if they  were  written one  by  one,  I  suppose  that  even  the  world   itself  could  not  contain  the  books   that  would  be  written"  (John  21:25).  

A  simple rule-of-thumb  is helpful  at the  outset.  Read carefully.  Don't  rush.  Then go back  and reread.  Soak up what the writer is saying.   One of the  Epistles  can  be  read  in a single  sitting, but this  is harder to  do with  the  Gospels,  which  are  much  longer.  However,  several  chapters of  a  Gospel  can  be  read  at  one  time and  then  reread.  

When  interpreting the  Gospels, it is important  to  establish  the  following,   as  far  as  possible:  (1)  the  historical events in Jesus' personal  life;  (2)  the  social  and  religious  context  within  which Jesus lived  and  ministered;  (3)  the personal  interests of  the men who wrote the  Gospels; and  (4) the  literary  context within  which  a particular sermon,  parable,  miracle, or  event  appears.  This involves careful  reading.  

Let's  consider  each of these four points for a minute. 
1.  Although  there  are  numerous  commentaries  and books  designed  to  help  a student  of the  Gospels  gain a deeper insight into Jesus' personal  life,  The   Desire    of  Ages,   by  Ellen G. White,  surpasses them  all.   With  inspired  insight,  this  book  guides  us  into  the  emotions  and  the  thinking  of Jesus from  His childhood to His sacrifice upon the cross.  Being able to feel what Jesus felt  brings the  Gospel  narrative to  life.  

2.    Two books,  from  among  the  many  that  are  available,  are  recommended  to  help  establish  the  social  and  religious  context  within  which  Jesus worked.  Jerusalem    in  the  Time  of  Jesus,   by  Joachim  Jeremias,  and  Everyman's     Talmud,  by Abraham Cohen,  help  to  establish  both the  social  and  the  religious context of Jesus' day. 

When  reading  the  Gospel  record of Jesus' healing blind  people,  one  cannot  help  but  ask  the  question,  "Why did  He  spit  into  the  eyes of  the  blind?"  (Mark  7:33;  8:23).   "Or why did He  make  clay out of spittle  and  smear it on  the  eyes?"  (John  9:6).   The  answer  can  be  found in Cohen's book,  and  the  significance of using spittle then becomes  clear.  

Cohen  says  that  the  following  belief  existed  in Jesus'  day,  "For  eye-trouble spittle was commonly used,  but we  are told  'there  is a tradition  that  the  spittle of the   first-born   son of a  father  has  healing powers,  but not  the  first-born    son of a mother'  (B.B.   126b)."[1]       

Now   to the  significance of  what Jesus did.  It was  commonly believed that Jesus was  the  illegitimate Son of Joseph by Mary.  Because Joseph fathered  sons before  he married Mary, Jesus was  not Joseph's  first-bom  (DA  86).    Therefore,  according  to  Jewish  folk  medicine,  Jesus  would  not  be  able  to heal  eye  diseases with His spittle.  The  spittle of a   first-bom  son of a woman, which was  Jesus' relationship with  Mary,  had no healing power either.   So  this would  also  exclude  Jesus  from  healing  eye  diseases  as  He  did.    Yet, Jesus was  able  to  correct  eye  problems  with  His  spittle.  Using  the  superstition of Jewish  folk  medicine,  Jesus gave evidence  that He  was  not  the  illegitimate  Son  of  Joseph,  as many accused Him of  being, but  was  who   He  claimed to be,  the  only  begotten  Son of God. 

3.   Establishing the  personal  interests  of the  Gospel  writers  is important.  Each writer was  touched by the saving grace of  Jesus and had  a deep interest  in who  He  was  and  what  he  said  and  did.  But each  gives  us  his  report  from  his own  frame  of reference.   Understanding  the  frame  of  reference helps  us  to  see  Jesus through  four  sets of eyes  and  thus  gives  us  a  more complete picture.  More will  be  said later about  the personal  interests  of  each  writer.

4.   As  is  true  in reading  any  portion of Scripture,  the  literary context must be clearly seen if we are  to understand  the  smaller portion being read Toi  gnore  the  context  can  lead  to misunderstanding  and wrong  interpretations of what  a passage actually is saying. 

### Why   Four  Gospels?  

One  question  that  has  been  asked  over  and  over  again  is, Why  are  there four   Gospels? Would  not  one  have been  sufficient to give us  a picture of Jesus, or would  not  five  or six have been  better  than  four?    There    is  nothing  sacred  about  the  number  four.   There  is  no  question  that  four  Gospels  give us  a more complete picture than one,  and,  evidently, four did what  God wanted,  so  we  do  not  have  five  or  six.  It is  interesting  to  note  that  Luke was  aware  that  "many"  accounts  had  been  written  about  Jesus  when  he picked up  his pen  and  began  his work.   "Inasmuch  as  many,"  he  says, "have taken in hand  to  set in order  a narrative of those things  which  have been  fulfilled  among  us ...  " (Luke  1:1).  

But   of these  "many"  who  wrote,  the  Holy  Spirit  chose  only  four  to  be  included in the NT:  Matthew,  a  former  tax  official,  who  had worked for   Herod  the  Tetrarch of Galilee  and  had  been,  we  may  safely  assume,  a  Herodian;   Mark,  whose  parents  were  devoted  followers of  Jesus, in whose  home  Jesus  ate  the  Last  Supper  with  His  disciples  and  who  may  have been the  young lad who  followed  Jesus and  the  apostles  to  the  Garden of Gethsemane,  escaping  those who  arrested  Jesus by  squirming out of  their  grasp,  leaving  the  linen  cloth  in which  he  had  wrapped  himself  in  the  hands of the  arresting  party  (Mark  14:51,  52); Luke,  a  Gentile  and  coworker with  Paul and with Mark (Philemon 24), and  a physician (Col 4:14); and  then  there  was  John,  the  beloved  disciple, who  gives  us  an  inspiring  account of Jesus, the  great "I  AM."  

### The   Synoptic  Challenge  

Three  of  the  four  Gospels   are  very  similar in  their  accounts.    Matthew, Mark,  and Luke are  called the  Synoptic Gospels;  that  is, they  give  a  "common view."  But if you read  them  carefully, you will  see   differences   in  each that   fill  in what  is lacking in the  others.  Any given Gospel  should  be read  first  of all  to understand  what  the  writer  is presenting  about  Jesus.  Once  this  is  clear,  then  comparisons  can  be  made with  the  other  Gospels  for  other  details.  

When  comparisons   are  made,  there  will  appear  to  be   discrepancies.   These differences  annoy  skeptics,  and they  are pointed to  as  evidence  that   Interpretation   of  the Gospels  and the   Epistles   the  Gospels  are  not trustworthy.  But the  synoptic writers were not  robots,  rigidly  adhering  to one  account  of Jesus' ministry that could not vary in the slightest.  Rather,  each writer was painting a portrait of Jesus, and the  various  differences  are  nothing but the touch of their brushes bringing out  different  shades in coloring.   Remember  each writer  is telling  us  about  Jesus  from  his own  frame  of reference.   Anyone reading  through the  Synoptics  will  immediately recognize  the  same portrait while being refreshed  by  the  different   shadings.   

The  differences  contained  in the  Synoptic  Gospels  are  known in  the  scholarly world  as  the  Synoptic Problem.  But these differences  are really not a problem.  They are, rather,  a tantalizing challenge.  A challenge  to  see  and to understand  Jesus  as the Gospel writer  saw  and understood  Him.  By  comparing  the  Synoptic  accounts  of Jesus'  miracles,  parables,   sermons,   and  His dealings  with  people,  you begin to  see  what  each writer  appreciated  about  Jesus.  You can  see  the touch of their paint brushes. 

While Matthew, Mark,  and Luke present a common view of Jesus'  life,  John  stands apart.  His Gospel  is the portrait that  fills  in the gaps left by  the  other  three  writers.  But even  at that,  remember,  with  the  four Gospels  we  still  do not have  a complete  account of Jesus'  life.   The  Synoptic  Gospels  probably  were  written  some twenty-five to thirty  years after  Jesus' ascension.  John was written  sometime  during the  last decade of the  first  century  A.D.   From his  vantage  point he  could see  what were  important events to him  that  had  been  left  out by  the  other  three,  and  so  he  shares them  with  us. 

For  example,  John  is the  only  writer  that  records  the  visit of Nicodemus  with  Jesus  immediately after  Jesus  cleansed  the  temple  for  the   first   time.  Ellen G. White makes the following  observation about this visit,  and  it  illustrates John's  personal  interest  and  how  he   filled  in missing  details,  "Nicodemus  related  to  John  the  story of that  interview, and  by  his  pen it was  recorded  for the  instruction of millions.  The truths there  taught  are  as  important  today  as  they  were  on  that  solemn night in the  shadowy  mountain,  when  the  Jewish  ruler  came to  learn  the  way of  life  from  the  lowly  Teacher  of Galilee" (DA 177). 

### Sources  of the  Synoptic  Gospels  

For  several  centuries,  the  majority  of NT  scholars  have  believed  that  Mark  was  written  before  Matthew  and  Luke.   Possibly  because  it  is  the  shortest  of the three  (although there  are  some who think Matthew was  written   first).   However,  some of the  accounts  of Jesus'  activities in Mark  are  more  detailed than  what  is  found in the  parallel  accounts  in Matthew  and  in  Luke.   Be  that  as  it may,  the  idea  is  that  both  Matthew  and  Luke  used  the written  account  of Mark  as  the basis  for their Gospels.   They then  used  another  written  document  called "Q"  (Q  from  the  German  word   "Quelle"   that  means  "source")   as  the  basis  for  the  material  they  have  in  common  that  is not found in Mark.   This is known as  the  two-document  hypothesis.  But  there  is  one  step  beyond  this.  Matthew and  Luke, it is believed,  each  had  access  to  written  material  that  they  used  and  to  which  other  writers  did  not  have  access.   So  the  two-document  hypothesis  is now  expanded  to  the  four-document  hypothesis.   The written  sources now line up  as  follows,  Mark  and  Q  were  both used  by Matthew and  by Luke  (the  two-document  hypothesis), Matthew used  a  source known as "M"  that Luke did not  have,  and  Luke  used  a  source known  as  "L"  that  Matthew did not  have,  which  gives the  four-document hypothesis  (Mark,  Q, M, and  L).  

However,  if you look  at Luke  1:1-4  carefully, he  appears to  be  telling  his readers that  he  and  the  "many" who  had  compiled narratives  of Jesus' ministry did not  use  written  sources but relied upon  oral accounts  of  eyewitnesses and ministers of the  Word.  

There  is no  evidence  that  the writers of the  Gospels  received  their  information  about  the  ministry of Jesus through inspired dreams or visions. Matthew  and  John were  apostles and  spent  a great  deal of time with Him. They  were  eyewitnesses of many  events  that  they  recorded.   Mark  knew  Jesus personally  but  did not  spend  the  time with  Him that  Matthew  and  John did.  Tradition has it that Peter was the source of information  recorded  by Mark.  Luke, on the  other hand, did not know Jesus personally, nor did he  ever  see  Him.  While  the  other  three  had personal  contact with  Jesus to varying  degrees, it was  Luke who  felt  he  must  explain to Theophilus,  and  anyone  else who might read  his  Gospel, how  he  acquired  his  information  about  Jesus.  

If  the  Gospel writers did not receive  inspired dreams and visions, how can  their  Gospel  accounts  of Jesus'  life  be  considered  as  inspired?    The    answer  is thought  inspiration, and it is  described  as  follows:  "It is not  the  words of the Bible that  are  inspired, but the men that were inspired.  Inspiration  acts not on the  man's words or his  expressions  but on the man  himself, who, under  the  influence of the Holy  Ghost,  is imbued with  thoughts"  (ISM  21).  Going a step further, we  are  told  that "God has  been pleased  to  communicate  His truth  to  the  world  by human  agencies, and  He Himself, by  His Holy  Spirit,  qualified  men  and  enabled  them  to  do  this work.   He   guided  the mind  in the  selection of what  to  speak and what  to write"  (GC  vi-vii). 

For example,  since Luke investigated the  life  of Jesus carefully  from  its  very beginning (1:1-4), why did he not record the visit of the wise men   from the  East?  Certainly, he  must  have  known  about  it, for it was  an important event that set the whole city of  Jerusalem  abuzz  and struck terror in the  heart  of  Herod  the  Great.  Did Luke not know about  this event,  or was  he guided by  the Holy  Spirit  to  select  instead  the  visit of the  shepherds, which  turned  out  to be  a brush  stroke in Luke's portrait of Jesus that we  do not  see  in the other  Gospels?  And what is there  about Luke's portrait of Jesus that  makes  the  visit of the  shepherds  a contribution  to his  Gospel while  the  visit  of the  wise men would  make  a contribution to Matthew's portrait?  We will  come  back  to these  questions  later.  By noting these differences,  even  little  ones,  the picture of Jesus  is  sharpened  as  it comes   from  the  pens of the  different  writers.   The  tantalizing challenge  is  to  note  these  differences  and  to   see   what contribution they make  to the overall picture. 

### The   Importance of the  Gospel of John 

Interpreting the Gospels  requires  a careful reading of  each.  One  of the  first things the reader will  look for is the major theme  or the  emphasis  that  the writer wishes  to bring  out. For example:  John's major  emphasis  is the divinity of Jesus.  The  opening verses of his  Gospel  set  the  tone  for what follows,  "In the  beginning was  the  Word,  and  the  Word  was  with  God,  and  the Word  was  God" (John  1:1).  This theme  is brought out  repeatedly  throughout John's Gospel by the  sermons,  parables,  debates, and  miracles  that the Holy  Spirit guided him to record.  After  a debate with  the religious leaders  over  their identity  and  His  identity,  Jesus nails  down who  He  is,  "Before Abraham was,  I AM"  (John  8:58).  So, watch for the major  theme  in  each  Gospel, because it will  vary from  book to book. 

The reader will  next look  for events  in Jesus' life  that  are  shared by the other Gospels  and then for details in these events  that are unique to the Gospel  he or she  is reading.  Having  done this, the reader will pool all of the  details  from  all four  Gospels  for a more complete understanding.  Variations in accounts  (the tantalizing challenges)  only help  to broaden  the picture.  For  example:  John's Gospel  is very important for our overall understanding of Jesus' life  and ministry  for three reasons:  (1) His record is made  up largely of  events  that the Synopics do not mention. Thus there  are few parallels;  (2)  When  he  does report  an  event  that  is parallel with  the  Synoptics,  he  adds  details that result in a more  complete understanding  of  what happened;   (3)   He  gives  us  a chronological time-frame for Jesus' ministry. 

1.    Here  are  a  few  examples  to  point number  one:  (a)  the  call  of a handful  of disciples  immediately following  the  forty  days  of temptation in  the  wilderness  (John  1:35-51);  in the  Synoptic  Gospels,  the  call  of the  disciples to full-time  ministry  comes  at  a later time (DA  246-247);  (b) the wedding  at Cana  (2:1-12); (c) the first  cleansing  of  the temple that inaugurated Jesus' ministry (2:13-22); (d) the visit of  Nicodemus (3:1-21); (e) the woman of Samaria  (4:1  -42);   (f) the healing of the crippled man at the pool on  the  Sabbath,  followed  by Jesus' arrest  and trial  on the charge of  Sabbath  breaking  (cf. DA, p. 204), and  His legal defense  before  the  council  of the  elders  during which  He  claims equality with  His Father,  because He  possesses life  as  a part of His  own nature  (5:1-47). And the  list  goes on.  Our  knowledge would  be  greatly restricted without  these independent  reports,  and John's chronology (point three  above)  helps  to arrange  this record and the record in the  Synoptics in a logical  sequence.  

2.    Except  for  the  final  hours  of Jesus'  life,  John  repeats very  little of the  information  that  can  be  found  in the  Synoptics.  And even in his record of  Jesus'  final  moments,  he  gives us  numerous  details  that  are unique to his Gospel.  In John  6, wefrnd  an  illustration of an event that John  has  in common   with the Synoptics.  By adding details, he deepens our understanding of what  is happening  and  enriches  our understanding of those events  recorded  in  the  Synoptics by including  information  that the  Synoptics do not report. 

John,  in his  report of  the  feeding of the  5000  (John  6), adds  the   following  facts:  (1) After  the  miracle of the  bread  and  fishes,  the multitude wanted to take Jesus by force to make Him  king (John 6:15).  (2) Knowing these people  were  only  interested in worldly power and not in eternal  life,  He   preached  the  Sermon  on  the  Bread of Life  (6:26-59).   (3)  From  the  content  of the  sermon,  the  people  realized that  Jesus had  no  intention of fulfilling  their political  ambitions but  was  calling  them  to  spiritual union with Him (John  6:53-58).  (4) The response to the  sermon  was  a mass  desertion of people who had claimed to be His followers,  only  one  day  after  they wanted to make Him  king by force (John 6:60-66).  (5)  This desertion was  so  extensive  Jesus asked  the Twelve, "Do you also want to go  away?"  (John  6:67).  The  Synoptics  do  not conclude  the  feeding of the  5000  with  these important details.  This is just one  illustration of how  a careful  reading  of one  Gospel  and  its comparison with  the  other  three  can  expand  our  understanding of the  events  in Jesus'  life.  

3.   The  Gospel  of John  gives  us  a  chronology of Jesus'ministry.  If  we  had  only  the  Synoptics, we would  have  to conclude  that Jesus'  ministry  was  much  shorter  than it really was.   John  establishes  his chronology around  four  Passovers.   Jesus  was  baptized  in the  fall  of A.D.   27  at  the  conclusion of  the  69 weeks of Daniel  9:25.  The  first  Passover was  the  following spring (A.D.  28, John 2:13) when Jesus cleansed  the temple for the first  time and inaugurated His ministry (chap. 2:14-22).  The next Passover (A.D.  29, John  5:1, cf. 2:13) brought His Judean ministry  to  a conclusion with  His arraignment  "before  the  Sanhedrin  to  answer  the  charge  of  Sabbathbreakin2" (John  5:2-47; DA 204).  The third  Passover (A.D.  30,  John  6:4)  saw  the  conclusion of His Galilean ministry  with  the  feeding  of the  5000  and  the  mass  desertion  of  His  professed   followers  (John  6:1-71).  The   final  Passover  (A.D.  31, John  13:1)  saw  His  arrest  and  His trial  and  the  crucifixion.  

On  the  basis of John's  chronology, we  can  put  the  events  recorded  m  the  Synoptics in their proper place.  Without  a doubt, John's Gospel  makes  a valuable contribution to interpreting and understanding  the  gospel story. 

### Interpreting  the  Synoptic  Gospels  

When  it  comes  to  interpreting the  Synoptic  Gospels,   at  least   three   questions  should be foremost in our minds: (1) Since John's Gospel, which establishes  a time frame  for Jesus' ministry,  was  written  decades  after  the  Synoptics,  where  did the  synoptic writers  get  the  order of events  we  see  in  their Gospels?   (2) What  do  the  variations in content  tells us?   (3) Is it possible  that Jesus repeated  His teaching,  sermons,  and parables,  adapting  them to  meet  the  needs and  interests  of varying  groups of listeners  in  different  geographic  locations?  

1.  In dealing with the  first  question, a reading of the  Synoptic  Gospels  suggests that  there  is  a  certain order of events  in Jesus'  life  that  is  shared  by  all three.   For  example:  If we  assume that Mark  was  written  first  and  that  he  recorded  the  memoirs  of Peter,  then  Mark  received  the  order of events  in his Gospel by listening to Peter's oral report (there  is no canonical  Gospel  authored  by  Peter).   This  means  that  imbedded  within  Peter's  oral report there  was  a basic  order of events  that took place in Jesus'  life.  

Luke  tells us  that he  gleaned  his Gospel  account  from  talking  personally  with  eyewitnesses   and  ministers of  the  Word.   Although  he  adds  a  great  deal of information  and makes  some adjustments,  Luke has  the  same  basic  order of events  that  can  be  found  in Mark.   Of course,  Luke was  a  co-laborer with  Mark  and  Paul and,  no  doubt, received much  information  orally  from  Mark  (Philemon 24). 

Then we have  the contributions of Matthew,  an eyewitness,  and  again  we  see  the  same basic  order of events.   One  cannot  help but conclude  that  there  already  existed in the  oral  tradition  about  Jesus a  basic  sequence of events  before  the  Synoptics were  written.  

There  is  another  point of interpretation of which  the  reader  must  be  aware.  It is clear  that  some events  in one  Gospel do not synchronize  with  the  others.  It is here that  a comment by Ellen  G. White  is helpful,   "There   is not  always  perfect  order  or  apparent  unity  in the  Scriptures.   The  miracles of Christ are  not  given in exact  order,  but  are  given just  as  the circumstances  occurred, which  called for this  divine  revealing of the  power  of  Christ" (ISM 20).  In other words,  some of the  miracles of Jesus were used  as  literary  illustrations of His power and  the  truths which  He  taught.  Therefore,  these miracles would  not  appear in the  same chronological  order in each of the  Synoptics.  

Mark  seems  to  record  the  bare  bones.   Matthew and  Luke  add  flesh  to  the  bones with  the  addition of information  not  found  in Mark,  but they rarely  upset  the  basic  sequence  of  events  by  their  additions.   It  is  true  that Matthew and Luke present  some events  and  parables  differently  than  Mark,  but here  is the  situation or place  in which  the tantalizing challenge comes  in.  And this  leads  us  to  the  second  question  that  must  be  kept in mind  when interpreting the  Synoptics.  

2.  The second  question deals with the variations found in the Synoptic Gospels.   Although  the  Synoptics  present  a common view  of Jesus'  ministry,  each  writer  shows  his own unique  interest  in who Jesus  is and  what  He  did from  his own point of reference.   It is their personal  interests  that  present  the  challenge  to  interpretation while    filling   in the  details  in  each  portrait of Jesus. 

Although  Mark  gives  us  the  bare  bones  of Jesus'  ministry,  he  does  have  a personal  interest in Jesus that is reflected in his Gospel.  This interest  is seen in the opening sentence, "The beginning of the  Gospel of Jesus Christ,  the  Son  of God" (Mark  1:1).   That  Jesus is  the  Son  of God  is  the  foundation  of the  good  news  about  Jesus,  and  each  event,  each  sermon,  and  each  parable  communicates  something  about  the  Son  whether  it  is  an acknowledgment by  demons  of His divinity  (Mark  1:24)  or telling  the  paralytic  his  sins  are  forgiven  and  then  establishing His authority to  forgive  sins before  the astonished  eyes of the  assembled  scribes by telling  the  paralytic to arise,  take  up his bed, and go home  (Mark 2:5-11). 

As we move  from  the basics presented  in Mark,  the personal  interests  that Matthew and Luke had in Christ become  very apparent.   For example, Matthew's  interest in Jesus screams for attention right  from  the  first  verse,  "The  book  of the  genealogy  of Jesus  Christ,  the  Son  of David,  the  Son  of Abraham."   This  statement  is  followed  by Jesus' genealogy  beginning  with Abraham, going down through the  kings of Judah,  to  Joseph,  Jesus'  adoptive father  (Matt  1:1 -17). 

The  Messianic  interest  in Jesus  is  clear.   He  is  the  Son of David;  He  was born in the royal  city of David  into  the household of Joseph, who  was  an heir to the  throne (though Jesus' conception was  a miracle by the  Holy  Spirit  [Matt  1:18]).   After  the  wise  men   from  the  East  came  looking  for  Him  who was  born King of the  Jews (Matt  2:2), Herod, in a jealous  rage,  attempted  to eliminate his competition for the  throne  (Matt  2:3-18).   The  Messianic  interest  is  also  evident  in Christ's  temptations  and  in His  Sermon   on the Mount.  The  last of the  three temptations in the wilderness  was  over the  issue  as to who was  to rule the kingdoms of  the  earth,  Satan  or  Jesus  (Matt 4:8-10).  Luke reverses the  last two temptations  [Luke 4:1-12]), and  the  Sermon  on  the Mount  (Matt  5-7)  was  designed  to give its hearers a  right  conception of Jesus' kingdom and of Him   as  the  King  (DA 299). It  might  be  added  that  this  sermon  also  was  designed  to  show  how  the  citizens of this kingdom are  to live.  The Beatitudes begin with  the poor in spirit  and  end  with  those who  are  persecuted  for righteousness'  sake,  and  both are assured they will  inherit the kingdom of  heaven.  Without  a doubt, Matthew  was  interested  in Jesus  as  the  Messianic  King  and  in His  kingdom.    This  interest  runs  throughout his  Gospel.  Once  the  reader  is  aware  of the  personal  interests  that  the  Gospel writer  has  in Jesus, he  can watch for  it  as  it surfaces.   Each  appearance broadens  the  overall  understanding  of  the  gospel  story.  

Minor  differences  can be  looked for, because they also help the  reader to  get  an insight into  the writer's interests.  For example, Matthew had been  an  employee  of Herod and would  have  been  viewed as  a Herodian and  sympathizer  with  Rome.  Knowing  this, the  record of the  healing of the  man  with  the  withered hand  by  the  Synoptic  writers  is  interesting.  This  miracle took place  in  a  synagogue  and  before  a  group of men who wanted  to  do  Jesus  in.   Luke  concludes  the  account  of  the  miracle  by  simply  saying  that  these men  "were   filled  with  rage  and  discussed  with  one  another  what  they  might  do  to  Jesus" (Luke  6:11).   Mark  identifies  these  men  as  Pharisees, noting that  they  left  the  synagogue  and plotted with  the Herodians  as  to how they might  kill Jesus (Mark  3:6).  Matthew,  being  a  former Herodian,  leaves  his  former  peers  out of the  murderous  plot  and  says,  "Then  the  Pharisees  went  out  and  plotted  against Him, how   they  might  destroy  Him" (Matt  12:14).   This  does  not  mean  that  Matthew  was  still  a Roman  sympathizer,  but it may  indicate that  he  put  the  blame  for  this  plot  upon  those  who  once  hated  him because of his position in Herod's  government.  

There  is  an  additional point of interpretation that  needs to  be  added  here before  we move on  to Luke.   Matthew was  a  co-laborer with  Jesus  and  an  eyewitness  of the  last two years of Jesus' ministry.  He was called to  discipleship immediately after  Peter, Andrew, James,  and  John  were  called  to  full-time  labor (DA 272).   Mark,  and  especially  Luke,  did not have  the  advantages of Matthew  as  an  eyewitness.    Therefore,  when  a  minor  discrepancy  appears,  logic  would  say,  Go  with  the   eyewitness.   The  account  of  the exorcism that took place on the east side of  the  Sea of Galilee in the country of the  Gadarenes  is  a good example of this.   Mark (5:2)    and  Luke  (8:27)  say  a  demon-possessed  man,  who  lived  in  the  tombs,  met  Jesus  as  He  got  out of the  boat.   Matthew, on the  other  hand,  says two  demon  possessed  men  met  Him (Matt  8:28).   Ellen  G.  White  follows  Matthew's account  (DA 337). 

Luke's interest in Jesus grows out of  his  personal  experience.   Luke was a  Gentile convert.   He  looked  at  Jesus  from  an  entirely different  frame of reference  than Matthew, Mark,  and John, who were Jews.  Because Gentiles were  despised  by  Jews,  Luke is  interested  in how  the  gospel  story and  the  ministry of Jesus relate  to  others  who  are  despised  or in a lower social  category.  For example,  while  Gabriel announced  the coming birth of Jesus to Joseph, the son of  David (Matt  1:20-21), the announcement  is made  to Mary in  Luke  1:26-38.  Women were generally held in low esteem. 

Matthew  records  the  visit  of the  wise  men  who were  looking  for  the  King  of the  Jews,  and Luke records  the  visit of the  shepherds  (Luke  2:820).    There  was  a  certain  nostalgia  attached  to  shepherding  in OT times, because king  David  had  been  a  shepherd.   However, in Jesus' day  the  occupation of a  shepherd  was  despised.[2]   It must  have  been  of great  interest  to  Luke that God bypassed  all of  the religious leaders to announce  the  birth  of  His   Son to  a despised  group of men. 

All three Synoptics quote the prophecy of Isaiah 40 concerning the ministry of John  the  Baptist, "The voice of one  crying in the wilderness  . . .," but  Luke alone  concludes  the  quote  by  drawing from  Isaiah  52:10, "And all  flesh  shall  see  the  salvation of God" (Luke  3:6), which  would  include  himself,  a despised  Gentile.  

While  Jesus' temptations  in the  wilderness,  as  recorded  by Matthew, end with  the  issue of who will  rule the nations of the  earth, which  fits  into  Matthew's  particular  interests,  in Luke's  Gospel  they  end  in  Jerusalem.  Jesus  is  taken  to  the  pinnacle of the  temple  and  Satan  tells Him to  prove  who   He is by throwing Himself down.  In Luke's order of the temptations, Jesus gained  the victory in His struggle with  Satan  within  the  heart of the very  city  that would  turn  on Him and  crucify  Him (Luke  4:9-13), the  city  in  which  Gentiles were  looked down upon. 

Only  Luke  records  the  story  of the  Samaritan  village  that   refused   hospitality  to  Jesus  and  His attitude  toward these  Gentiles  as  compared  with  what  James  and  John  wanted  to  do  to  them  (Luke  9:51-55).   Luke   alone  records  the  story  of the  good  Samaritan  (Luke  10:25-37)  and  of  the  cleansing of the  ten  lepers who were  outcasts of society and  the  one,  who   happened  to  be  a  Samaritan  Gentile, who  returned  to  thank  Jesus  for  what  He  had  done  for him (Luke  17:11-19).   Luke  also  reports  the  parable of the  Pharisee and the  tax collector praying in the temple  (Luke  18:9-14)  and  Jesus accepting  the  hospitality of Zacchaeus,  the  despised tax  collector  (Luke  19:1-10).   It  is  clear  that  Luke  is  interested  in  how  Jesus,  the  Savior  of the  world,  related  to  non-Jews  and  to  those of  the  Jewish  nation who  were  despised.  

The  tantalizing  challenges   seen in  additions  and  in  omissions  in  the  Synoptic  accounts only add  to the  broader  picture of Jesus' life  and ministry.  An interested  reader of the  Gospels will  watch for them  and  be  aware  of  them  when  they  appear,  compare  them  with  parallel  accounts  in  the  other two Synoptics  to  see  how each change deepens the understanding  of  what  is  written.  

3.   Now  the   final  question,  Is  it  possible  that  some  variations  in  the  Synoptic  accounts  resulted  from  Jesus  repeating  His  teaching  to  various  groups  of people?   This  is, indeed,  what  happened.   Preachers  often  present  a  sermon  more  than  once,  altering it here and  there to  suit  the  different  audiences they  address.  The  teachings  and parables of Jesus contain truth that  He  wanted  all to  hear.   What  He  taught  in Judea would  certainly  be  repeated  for the  benefit of those who  lived in Galilee.  And the  same truth might  be  presented  with  a  different  emphasis  and  with  varying illustrations. 

Ellen  G. White makes the following  comment, "A considerable  part of the closing months  of  Christ's ministry was  spent in Perea, the province on 'the  farther  side  of the  Jordan'  from  Judea.   Here  the  multitude  thronged  His   steps,  as  in  His  early  ministry in  Galilee,  and  much  of  His  former  teaching  was  repeated" (DA 488). 

Understanding  that  each of the  Gospel  writers paints  a portrait of  Jesus  as  he  sees Him will  go  a long way in helping to  interpret  the  Gospels  and  in resolving  the  differences  that  are  encountered.    These   differences   are  not  to be  looked upon  as  errors  or  something  that renders the  Gospels  unreliable  but  as  tantalizing challenges  that  expand  our own view of who Jesus is and what  He  taught  and did. 

## 2.  Interpreting the  Epistles  

In  addition  to  the  Gospels  (accounts  of the  life  and  ministry of Jesus), Acts (history of the  early church) and Revelation (prophecy), the NT  contains  a body of documents  sent to Christian congregations  or to individuals.  These  documents  are  generally  called Epistles.   There  is  a question  as  to whether  a  distinction should be made between  an Epistle, a literary production to be  read  by  all,  and  a letter which  is seen  as  personal  correspondence.  

From this collection of documents,  those that  are  genuine  letters,  generally, follow  the format of  any  other  letter of  that time.  The author  identifies  himself by name in the  opening  salutation,  and  the  recipient  is  identified.   This is followed  by a greeting, a prayer  or expression  of  thanksgiving,  then  the  body of the  letter,  and  the  farewell (e.g.,  Romans,   1 Corinthians, etc).    Some of the  epistles  lack  the  formal  introduction (e.g.,  Hebrews,  1  .   John)  and  others the  final  farewell (e.g., James). 

### Content  of  the  Epistles  

The  Epistles  are  not  theological expositions.   They  were  intended  for  practical instruction in Christian living,  spiritual nurturing of the  reader(s),  correction  where  needed,  encouragement,  and  admonition.   Some of  the  Epistles  address  theological  issues  to  enlighten  the  reader(s),   to  correct  misunderstandings,  and  to confront  outright error,  but they were  not  written  as  theological  expositions.  

_Example:_    In  Romans,   Paul  develops  justification  and  righteousness  by   faith,  but  this  is  not  the  sole  intent  of  this  Epistle.   In  Galatians,   he   confronts  the  error of'"another gospel"   that  is not  a gospel.   The majority of  Hebrews  is  devoted  to  a  masterful  presentation  of Jesus' work  as  our  High  Priest  in the  heavenly  sanctuary  using  the  earthly  sanctuary  and  its  services  as  a type of the  heavenly,  but it also contains  practical advice  on  Christian  living.  

The  following  approach  to  a study of the  Epistles  will  prove  helpful:  

1.    Because  of  the  varied  nature  of  the  content  of  the  Epistles,  the  practice  of  reading  an  Epistle through in one  sitting is  a  sound  procedure.  

2.     Then reread  it slowly  and  carefully.  

3.    On  a  sheet of paper, divide the  content  of the  Epistle  into  logical  sections.   One  section  for theological  study,  another  for  identifying  problems  the writer is addressing,  another  section  for counsel  and  for advice in practical Christian living,  etc. Having done this, each section  can  be given undivided  attention.  

4.     While  dividing  an  Epistle  into  sections  for  further   study,   note   words  that  may  produce  insights  from  a word  study.  For  example,  comparing verses in which  Paul  uses the  word  "righteous"  or  "righteousness"  is  an  interesting  study.   It will  be  seen  that  these two  words  are  used  to  address the  faith  experience  as  well  as  living  a  life of  obedience.  

First Corinthians  15:29 produces interesting results  from  a word  study.  This  is  the  sole  verse  used  by  some  people  to  support  vicarious  baptism  and  thus  salvation for the  dead.  In this word  study two things  must  be  noted: (1) the use  of the  Greek preposition huper,  generally translated  "for" or "on  behalf of";  and  (2) the presence and  the  absence of the  definite article ("the  dead" and  "dead people,"  in  general).  

1.    The  preposition huper  means "over"  or  "above"  and,  as  noted,  is  commonly translated "for" or "on behalf of."    Within  the context of salvation,  the  word  conveys  the  idea of a  protective  shield over  the  repentant  sinner  that  absorbs  the  punishment  deserved  by  the  sinner.   Thus,  Christ  as  a  vicarious  sacrifice  paid  the  penalty of the  broken  law  on  behalf of sinners  and  becomes  their Protective  Shield, (cf., Rom  5:6,  8;  8:32,  etc.)  However,  human  beings  cannot  gain salvation vicariously for another  human   being, because both are  sinners.   Therefore,  vicarious baptism (a  living  person  being baptized "for" (huper)   a dead  person),  is contrary to  the  gospel  and  to  Paul's  theology of righteousness  by  faith.   Therefore,  in  1  Corinthians  15:29, huper  must take on  a different meaning. 

Pagans in Paul's  day  saw  that the  grace of Jesus and His resurrection were  the  only  hope  that  they  had  of being  reunited with  departed  loved  ones who had  become  Christians before  they  died.  Paganism  held out  no  hope of a reunion or  a resurrection.  Because of the  Christian hope  in the resurrection,  pagans  were  turning  to  Jesus  as  their  Savior, believing that through  His  grace  they would  be  reunited with  dead  loved  ones  at  Jesus'  return.   Thus,  the  living  were  being  "baptized  for  the  sake of or  because  of  the  dead"  or,  as  Paul  puts  it, "for  the  dead"  (cf. G. G.  Findlay's commentary  on  1 Corinthians in  The  Expositor    s  Greek   Testament  for  further  discussion on this verse).    If the  Corinthians actually were being baptized for  dead  relatives, with  the  idea  that their baptism would  vicariously  save  the  dead,  Paul would  have  come  down hard  on this heresy  in his  letter  to  them.  But his casual mention of what was being done  indicates  he had  no  problem with it. 

2.    In this verse there  is a definite article before  the  first  appearance of the word translated "dead"  (ton  nekron,  genitive case), thus  indicating that "the  dead"  are  a specific group among all the  dead, in this case Christians. The  second  appearance of the  word  translated  "dead"  (nekroi,   nominative   case)  has  no article, thus  indicating the  dead  in general.  The KJV and  the  NKJV  have  a  third  appearance of  ton  nekron  in  the  last  sentence of  the  verse.   But  the  oldest  Greek  manuscripts  read  "for them"  (huper    auton),    referring  back  to  the  first  appearance of the  word  "dead."   As  a  result of this word  study,  the  verse  can  be  understood  to  say,  "Why are  people  being  baptized  because of their hope  of being  reunited with  their  departed,  Christian loved ones, if the  dead in general  are  not raised?"  First Corinthians  15:29 now becomes  a strong affirmation  for belief in the resurrection, as it gives us insight into what was happening historically within the  pagan  culture of Paul's  day.  

To   do  a  word  study,  a  Greek/English  Dictionary  will   be   needed.   There  are  several  that  can  be  purchased,  such  as  An  Expository        Dictionary    of  Biblical      Words  by  W.  E.  Vine.    The  three  volume      Theological      Lexicon     of  the  New   Testament  by Ceslas  Spicq  is also  helpful.   For  those  who   want  to  get  serious  about  word  studies,  there  is  the  three-volume  Exegetical     Dictionary      of  the  New   Testament   by Horst Balz and  Gerhard  Schneider  and  the  multivolume  Theological     Dictionary      of  the  New  Testament,   edited  by  Gerhard  Kittel.   Also,  The  New  Englishman    s    Greek    Concordance      of  the  New  Testament   is  a helpful  tool.  

### Historical  Context  

As   with  the  study  of the  Gospels,  establishing  the  historical context of  an  Epistle  is  important.  With  the  Epistles  it is  necessary  (1) to  gather  as  much information  about  the  author  as  possible  and  (2) to  gather  all the information  available  about  the  congregation  or  individual  to  whom  the  Epistle  is sent. 

1.   Except  for Jude, the  names of the  authors of the  Epistles  appear in the  Gospels  and  in Acts.   It  is  from  these two  sources  that  the historical context of the  writers can  be  reconstructed.   We know  a great  deal  about  Paul,  Peter,  and  John,  much  less  about  James,  and  nothing  about  Jude  other  than that  he  claims to be  the  brother of James (Jude  1).  This  would  make him, together  with  his brother,  a son of Joseph (cf, Mark  6:3).  

From  the  Epistles  themselves,  we  can  glean  some  information  about  the  personal  situation of the  author  when  he  wrote. For  example,  when  Paul wrote Romans,  he  had wanted to get to the capital city of the  empire  for  some time  so  that he  could  share some gift  with  the Roman  Christians  and  strengthen  them in the  faith  (Rom  1:11,  12),  as  well  as win converts to  Christ (1:13), but  he  had  not  been  able  to  do  so  (1:13).  His plan  was  to  take  the  material assistance  donated  by  the  churches  in Greece  and in Macedonia to the poor in Jerusalem  and then  stop by in Rome  on his way to  Spain (15:26-32). 

When  Paul  wrote his  letters  to  the  Philippian  Christians,  Timothy,  Titus,  and  Philemon, he  was  a prisoner in Rome.   James wrote to  Jewish  Christians  scattered  throughout  the  Roman  Empire,  as  did Peter in his  First Epistle. 

When Paul wrote to the Galatian churches,  his position, authority, and teaching  as  an apostle  were being challenged by critics who followed him to  these churches  and were teaching  a gospel  that was  different from  what  he  taught  (Gal  1:1,6-11).   First and  Second  Corinthians were  written  to  a  church  that  also  challenged  Paul's  authority (2 Cor  1:23-2:5).  

Picking up these tidbits helps  in interpreting what the  author  is saying in  the Epistle.  

2.   Establish  the  historical context  of the  reader by  going  to  a  Bible  dictionary  and finding  out all you can  about  the  city, region, or  individual  to whom the  Epistle  is  addressed.   The  Interpreter   s Dictionary    of the   Bible,  published by Abingdon  Press, is  a useful  tool.  

Also,  from  the Epistle itself and  from  other  sources try to establish  the  makeup  of the  congregation.    If  the  Epistle  is  addressed  to  an  individual,  what  was  the  relationship  between  the  author  and  the  reader?   If  there  were problems  within  the  congregation, what were  they, and how does  the  author  address  them?  

For  example,  over  sixteen  double-column  pages in  _The  Interpreter   s   Dictionary     of  the  Bible_   are  devoted  to  the  city of Corinth and  to  the  two  Epistles  that  Paul  wrote  to  the  Corinthian Christians.   The  city  was  very  cosmopolitan,  a thriving  center of commerce,  and located near the place in which  the  ancient  Greek  Olympic Games were held. 

A problem can be picked up in the Epistle itself.  Being a commercial center, it drew people  from  various parts  of the  empire who  spoke  different Ian-guages.  This may have been the root of the problem with  speaking in tongues in this church.  None of  the other  churches  seems to have had this problem. 

The  Epistles  to  Timothy  and  Titus  speak  for  themselves.    Paul  had  a  very  close  relationship with  these two men,  calling both of them his  sons.  They  had  shared  with  Paul  the joys  and  the  pain of preaching  the  gospel  to  a pagan  world.   Paul's relationship with  Philemon was  that of a  mature  fellow  worker.  He was  a friend  from  whom Paul wanted to  collect a  debt  in taking back  as  a brother in Christ, Onesimus,  a runaway  slave  who  had  wronged Philemon. 

### Application  of  Content  

Perhaps the greatest challenge  connected  with  interpreting the  Epistles  is  deciding what  is  relevant  for today.  It is dangerous to  dismiss  counsel  and instruction that  irritates us by saying that  it just does not fit  our modern cultural context.  Gordon Fee  and Douglas  Stuart make  a valid point when they  say  that  what we  share today with  the  original  reader(s)  is meant  for  us  too.[3]  

Another  problem  with  interpreting the  Epistles  is  trying  to  make  an  Epistle  say  what  it originally  did not  say  and  trying  to  answer   questions   that  are  not  asked  within  the  context of the  Epistle.  Again  Fee  and  Stuart  have  sound  counsel  for interpreting an Epistle; the text cannot  mean  what  it did not mean  to the  author  and  to  the  reader(s).[4]    

How  then  do  we  today  understand  instruction that  was  given in  the  first  century A.D.  context?   Here  are  some helpful   suggestions:[5]         

1.   Determine  the  central  core of the  message contained  in an  Epistle  and  then  address the  instruction that  is dependent upon  that  core.  
_Example:_   The  fallen,  helpless  condition of man in sin is  at the heart of most of the  messages in the  Epistles  as  is  redemption  in Christ  from  this  fallen  condition through His  death  and  resurrection.   Justification,  sanctification,   and  the return of Jesus are  also  core  material.  Understanding  the  instruction  for Christian behavior  and  life  style  is today just  as  dependent  upon  an understanding of the  core  material  as  it was when it was  written.  

2.    Identify  what the  Epistles  see  as  inherently moral and what  is not. Moral  behavior  that  was  based  upon  God's  law  at  the  time  the  Epistles  were  written  is moral behavior today,  for God's  law does not  change.  
_Example:_   The  list of positive behavior given by Paul in Philippians 4:8 remains  a guide  for us  today.  Let the mind  dwell  on things  that  are  good,  noble, just,  pure,  lovely,  of good  report,  and  that  which  has  virtue.   By   contrast,  the  sin list  in  1 Corinthians  6:9-10  applies just  as  much  today  as  it did when Paul compiled it. 

3.    Make  a list of items  that  are  consistent  throughout  the  Epistles.  
_Example:_    Love  is  to  be  the  basis  for  all interaction with  our  fellow  men, love that  is of the quality that brought Jesus to Calvary,  self-renouncing love.  Non-retaliation would  fit under  the category of love.  Then  there  are  strong  statements  against  strife,  hatred,  murder,  stealing,  immorality,  and  drunkenness.  

4.    Distinguish between  a principle and  a specific application. 
_Example    of  a  principle:_  There   are  two  underlying  principles  that  Christians  today  must  note  that  grow  out  of Paul's  counsel  to  the  Corinthians:  (1) Although  we  may  not  live  in  a  culture in which  the  temptation  to  feast  in  an  idol's  temple  exists  and  we  may  not  expose  ourselves  to  the  immorality  that  once  existed  in  these  temples,  we  are  faced  with  demonic  activity  that  is much more  subtle.  We  can  identify  it  everywhere  in  our postmodern  culture.  In some cultures of our world  today,  the  danger  that  the  Corinthians  faced  still  exists.   But the underlying principle is that toying with  anything that  exposes us  to  demonic  activity  places  us in grave  spiritual danger.  Within  the  Corinthian context, Paul recognized  the  danger.   (2) The  second  principle is  that  toying  with  the  demonic  powers  disqualifies  us  for companionship  with  Jesus.  We cannot  have fellowship with  Satan and  then  expect  to have fellowship with  Jesus.  

_Example    of  a  specific    application:_    Paul  had  strong  words  for  those  Corinthian  Christians  who were  feasting  in the  temples  of idols in  1 Corinthians  8  and  10.   These  temple  feasts  were  spread  in honor of the  god  represented  by  the  idol.   And, of course,  demonic  power  was  behind  the  idol.   By  eating  at  these  feasts,  the  participants  were  showing  a  willingness to  enter  into a covenant  relationship with  the god being thus  honored.  A  Christian  cannot  cozy  up  to  a  demon.    So  in  1 Corinthians  10:20-21,  Paul  is  absolutely  clear  as  to  the  fallout  of such  behavior:   "Rather,  that  the  thing  which  the  Gentiles  sacrifice  they  sacrifice  to  demons  and  not  to  God,  and  I  do  not want you to  have fellowship with  demons.   You  cannot  drink the  cup of  the Lord  and the cup of demons;  you cannot  partake  of the  Lord's  table  and of the  table of  demons."  As  the  Epistles  are  read  and  reread  and  work  sheets  and  word  studies  are  developed,  the  reader becomes  accustomed  to  look  for underlying principles  that  can  become  a guide  for  the  twenty-first-century Christian. By  following  the  steps outlined above  the  core  message of the  Epistles  can  be  seen clearly and then  separated  from  peripheral instruction.
