## CHAPTER IX 

# INTERPRETING OLD TESTAMENT HISTORICAL NARRATIVE 

Greg A. King 

## Introduction 

The Bible-contains more literature that fits under the rubric "historical narrative" than any other literary genre.[1]  Nearly half of the Old Testament is of this nature and over one-third of the entire Bible. [2]  In the Old Testament the books of Genesis, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, and Jonah are largely written in historical narrative. Also, substantial parts of other books such as Exodus and Ezekiel appear in this form. In the New Testament the Gospels and Acts are largely of this genre.[3] 

In light of the pervasiveness of historical narrative in Scripture, it is vital that this genre be interpreted properly if God's Word is to be understood correctly. This chapter will list and explain some guidelines that are helpful to use when interpreting the historical narrative sections of the Bible. Additionally, we include a sample interpretation of a historical narrative section from the book of Ruth. 

This article assumes use of the general hermeneutical principles applicable to every portion of Scripture (i.e., having an accurate translation, understanding the context, application, etc. See chapter 7, "Guidelines for the Interpretation of Scripture"). However, specific guidelines are particularly important when approaching certain genres of the Bible, and here we will set forth, develop, and nuance these guidelines in such a way that they focus specifically on the interpretation of historical narrative. In line with the design of this volume, these guidelines will primarily be discussed in relationship to verses found in the "Historical Books" section of the Old Testament, as given in the English canon (the books of Joshua through Esther). However, they also apply to the other historical narrative sections of Scripture.

## 1. Guidelines for Interpreting Historical Narratives [4] 

### Read the Text Closely 

A close reading of the text is essential. In historical narrative, as well as with other biblical genres, it is vital to pay attention to the details of the story, even to those that, at the time, may seem insignificant or superfluous. For example, the careless reader might overlook the seemingly minor detail about Absalom's vain behavior regarding his hair (2 Samuel 14:26). However, Absalom's vanity towards his hair is an important point, because it anticipates the cause of his demise. This underscores the fact that the text itself must be carefully read and closely studied. 

### Study Literary Features 

It is important to notice the various literary features that make up the narrative sections of Scripture. At a minimum, the following elements of each passage should be studied: the plot, the setting, the characters, and the narrator's viewpoint. [5] 

**_Plot._** Discovering the plot involves answering the What? and the How? questions. It is the sequence of events that compose the narrative. It is what holds the story together. To discover the plot, ask, What is this story about? The setting deals with the When? and Where? questions. What is the time and place in which a certain narrative is set? For example, the book of Ruth is said to take place during the era when the judges ruled (Ruth 1:1). When understood against this setting, it stands in contrast to the violence and the anarchy consuming the nation of Israel at that time. Also, the book of Ruth begins at Bethlehem, the name of which has the ironic meaning "house of bread," because the land is in the grip of famine right then. 

**_Characters._** The characters are the people involved in the story, those who move the plot forward. It is very important to analyze how the various characters are portrayed in order to interpret historical narratives correctly. For example, a careful analysis of the character of Samson pays rich dividends in the interpretation of Judges 13-16. Though one of the strongest men who ever lived, he is at the same time one of the weakest. His weakness with women, manifested in previous dalliances (Judges 14 and 16), prefigures his ultimate undoing at the hands of one. 

**_Narrator's Viewpoint._** The narrator's viewpoint, refers to the theological perspective of the one who relates the narrative—to the point he or she is trying to make. The narrator's viewpoint comes to us in a variety of ways. For example, sometimes it appears in the arrangement and in the structure of the narrative, sometimes by the words uttered by the characters, and, at other times, by explicit comment or by summary statements, delineating the meaning of a certain narrative. As an example of the latter, who can miss the narrator's negative assessment of the chaos in the Israelite nation during the days of the judges, appearing in the epilog of the entire book? "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit" (Judges 21:25). 

**_Other Features._** Other literary features in historical narratives, such as comparison/contrast and irony, could also be mentioned, but to conelude this point, there is no substitute for analyzing the plot, the characters, and other features in order to understand the meaning of the narrative sections of the Bible. 

### Take Note of Repetitions 

Repetitions are commonly used in historical narrative. Recurring words and phrases can be helpful in determining the meaning intended by the author. For example, Jeroboam, son of Nebat, is used repeatedly as a standard of comparison, the monarch who set the pattern for the evil kings of the Northern Kingdom succeeding to the throne (1 Kings 15:34; 16:7,26). Any king said to follow the ways of Jeroboam clearly will be no agent of spiritual revival. 

As another example, the astute Bible student who reads that Adonijah, as part of his plan to usurp the throne, rides in a chariot with 50 men running ahead of him (1 Kings 1:5) already can sense that Adonijah is heading for doom, for the same had been done by Absalom as part of his unsuccessful power grab (2 Samuel 15:1). 

### Look for the Divine Perspective

A fourth guideline to remember is that historical narratives are not attempting merely to relate the story of people who lived in ancient times, but they are mainly about how God worked in and through his children—and sometimes in spite of them. There is a divine perspective to these stories. In light of this, it is appropriate to use the term "theological history," since the historical narrative also intends to communicate theological truth to the reader.[6]  For example, the last few verses of 2 Kings are not only trying to tell us of the good fortune of Jehoiachin in being released from prison and in being allowed to eat at the table of the Babylonian king; rather, this passage is attempting to show that God has not abandoned his covenant people and is still working redemptively on their behalf, even in the dark night of exile. 

Here, we need to affirm the importance of reading each narrative, not only in light of its own immediate context but in the context of the entire plan of redemption. That is, each narrative unit should be read in light of the Great Controversy as a whole. 

The message of the Old Testament historical narratives operates on three levels.[7] The top level is God's plan and purpose for the human race, including God's perfect creation, the fall, and Christ's incarnation, sacrifice, and offer of salvation. The middle level focuses on Israel, including God's call of Abraham, deliverance of his descendants from bondage in Egypt, their apostasy and exile, and their restoration. The lower level is composed of the events and incidents in all the individual narratives that make up the larger story. For example, the narrative of Ruth not only demonstrates God's love for two individual widows and their friendship with one another (the lower level), it also shows Ruth's important role in the nation of Israel as she becomes an ancestress of the great King David (the middle level). Reading further in the Bible (see the genealogy in Matthew 1), one discovers that Ruth has a place in the family tree of the Messiah (the top level) and thus plays a role in God's plan of redemption. It is important to consider an individual Old Testament narrative at each of these levels and ask such questions as: What is happening in this specific story? What role does it play in God's plan for the covenant nation? How does it fit into the entire plan of redemption? 

### Recognize the Exemplary Nature of Narratives 

Historical narratives do not normally proclaim a direct biblical command or teach a biblical doctrine. They may well assume and illustrate a command or a doctrine taught elsewhere. An example of this is the Elijah narrative. Though there is no explicit command in 1 Kings 17-18 not to worship other gods, as is stated in the Ten Commandments, it is clearly assumed by the narrator and by Elijah that it is sinful for the people to worship Baal. The outcome on Mt. Carmel confirms this assumption. The narrator of 1 Kings assumes from Deuteronomy the dangers inherent in great riches and in foreign women and provides only a short account of how Solomon turns away from God (1 Kings 10:14-11:10). Thus, one of the purposes of historical narratives is that they often serve as powerful illustrators of biblical commands given elsewhere. 

### Evaluate the Actions of the Characters 

A final interpretive guideline to note is that biblical historical narratives record what actually happened, not necessarily what God wanted to happen. In keeping with this, it is important to remember that readers of the Bible are not called to imitate all the actions of the biblical characters, even those of the so-called heroes of Scripture. Certainly David's sin with Bathsheba and his murder of her husband are not worthy of emulation, even though David is referred to as a man after God's own heart. Rather, his actions are morally evil, gross violations of God's standard of conduct. While in David's situation the text explicitly states that his action displeased the Lord (2 Samuel 11:27), sometimes the narrative unit does not state clearly the divine assessment of a certain act. Rather, the reader must look at what the text implies and what the Bible states elsewhere. 

While there are other interpretive guidelines that could be adduced, the aforementioned ones should provide some helpful guidance in discerning the meaning of the Bible's historical narratives. 

## 2. An Example of Historical Narrative Interpretation 

This brief review of the book of Ruth provides an example of how a historical narrative section of Scripture might be interpreted and applied today. Though it focuses on Ruth 2:1-13, it also deals with certain major themes of the entire book and attempts to understand these themes in light of the Bible as a whole. Additionally, it notes some of the literary features and uses some of the guidelines that are mentioned above. 

### Exposition of Ruth 2:1-13 

The more things change, the more they remain the same. Or so the saying goes. And so it was for Naomi and Ruth. Notwithstanding a change of address from Moab to Bethlehem, the same old problems and uncertainties persistently plague the lives of these two widows. Their plight was a desperate one. In a cruel irony, although they now lived in the "house of bread" (the meaning of the name Bethlehem), they were stalked by hunger. Other challenges loomed large also. They were locked in poverty, overwhelmed by loneliness, uncertain of their acceptance by the Israelite community, and convinced that their situation was due to divine judgment (Ruth 1:20-21). They faced the extinction of their family line due to the lack of a male descendant to inherit the estate and carry on the family name. They seemed on the verge of just giving up. This "house of bread" was no cornucopia for them! 

Confronted by seemingly insolvable situations, perplexed about the present, worried about the future, wondering if life is worth living, if there is anything to hope for, we are the Ruths and Naomis of today. 

When mired in such difficult and desperate circumstances, what do we need to know? What God-given message will bring us courage? What biblical truth can give birth to hope? The answer comes in the very message that Ruth 2 proclaims, namely, that God is actively working on behalf of His children to bring about redemption and restoration. The Almighty has not forgotten or abandoned us. To the contrary, the God who proclaims elsewhere, " I will never leave you or forsake you" (Hebrew 13:5, NRSV), is already arranging events and circumstances so as to bring about a glorious renewal. 

Note how Ruth chapter 2 expresses this message. The first verse hints at the coming restoration by introducing the person through whom it will later be accomplished, Naomi's wealthy relative, Boaz. At this point in the narrative, Naomi and Ruth are not thinking of Boaz as a candidate to extricate them from the pit into which they have fallen. In fact, judging from her later comments, Ruth knows nothing about him at all. However, he is already in place and possesses resources that will be used to bring about a reversal of their fortunes. There is a redeemer, as Boaz will be designated later, waiting in the wings. In Ruth 2:20 and 3:9, 12, the participle form of goal denotes Boaz; the NIV translates this as "kinsman-redeemer." 

In keeping with the foregoing paragraph, perhaps we need to add the phrase "prevenient providence" to our theological lexicon. Some already are acquainted with the concept of prevenient grace, though probably not everyone (one of my dictionaries does not even have an entry for the adjective "prevenient"). It refers to the divine grace already working on a person's heart prior to that person's turning to God. Although theologians seldom speak of prevenient providence, the book of Ruth establishes the validity of the concept. Simply by introducing Boaz, the agent of redemption and by alluding to his abundant resources, the author is suggesting that God already is at work and has a plan to accomplish His purposes. Although tear-stained eyes, whether of Naomi and of Ruth in ancient times or of our own in modern times, are often oblivious to the fact, God already is working to redeem and to restore. 

But what should Ruth and Naomi do, in the meantime, before God's plan comes to fruition? To do nothing was to starve, so Ruth suggested a plan. In accord with the stipulation permitting the poor to gather grain left by the harvesters (Leviticus 19:9-10; 23:22; Deuteronomy 24:19-22), she proposed finding a field in which she would be allowed to glean. So she headed out, and "as it happened" (Ruth 2:3, NRSV), or so the Bible says, she came to the field of Boaz. 

"As it happened." What is the meaning of this phrase? Is the author suggesting that Ruth's encounter with Boaz, an event that takes on enormous significance as the plot of the book unfolds, is simply a coincidence, a  stroke of good luck that she gleaned in his field instead of someone else's? Not at all! Although it may appear to the reader that Ruth stumbled on the field of Boaz by accident, this "labeling of Ruth's meeting with Boaz as 'chance' is nothing more than the author's way of saying that no human intent was involved. For Ruth and Boaz it was an accident, but not for God."[8]  A study of the Hebrew verbal root used here (qarah) buttresses this point, for "Yahweh often lurks in contexts where qrh occurs."[9] Here, the author is attempting to make a point about divine providence. Divine providence means God's care for His children, His general supervision over them, and His ordering and working out of events so as to fulfill His plan in their lives. Providence in the book of Ruth is not of the spectacular, miraculous, "fireworks-in-the-sky" variety. To the contrary, much of God's activity "is very much that of one in the shadows, the one whose manifestation is not by intervention but by a lightly exercised providential control." [10]  But it is there all the same, and the events that occur subsequent to Ruth's encounter with Boaz all have the feel of being part of the divine plan to redeem and to restore Ruth and Naomi. Boaz' interest in, and kindness to, Ruth; her corresponding attraction to him; the outcome of his dealings with the other kinsman; their marriage union; and production of an offspring, who ultimately redeems Naomi (4:14-15), seem meant to be. But what about the present? Dare we affirm God's providential leading of His children today? Dare we proclaim divine involvement in our own lives? In light of the teaching of Scripture, not only in the book of Ruth but in all sixty-six books, dare we not? The Ruths and the Naomis of today, worried and hopeless, need desperately to hear the message that the same God who knows when a sparrow falls (Matthew 10:29) cares deeply about them, that He is interested and involved in their lives. They need to be reminded of the gift of redemption that He has provided and the ultimate restoration that He promises. In fact, this redemption and restoration was provided in a climactic way by none other than the great redeemer par excellence, the one whom Boaz foreshadowed in several respects, Jesus Christ. Like Boaz, Jesus claims kinship with those whom He redeems (Heb 2:11), and like Boaz, He is willing to redeem, even though redemption comes at a cost. But today redemption and restoration are not always immediately evident in the lives of God's children. The Lord does not wave a magic wand and, "Voila" the difficulties and problems immediately disappear. For example, when the passage under consideration here concludes (2:1-13), Ruth and Naomi still face the problems of poverty, hunger, and the threat of family extinction. It is true that Ruth has met the wealthy and friendly Boaz, but the small cache of food she has gathered will be devoured quickly, and she and Naomi must still deal with the same problematic situation In one sense, nothing has changed. But in another sense, everything has changed, for Ruth has encountered the agent of redemption! Redemption and restoration are on the march and, ultimately, will be visible i n the lives of these two widows. The positive outcome is not in doubt. To the contrary, it is as certain as the promises of God. And so it is with us. Our status as the redeemed of God, our future in His kingdom, while not always apparent now, is as sure as tomorrow's sunrise. 

Something more should be said about one of the objects of redemption and restoration, Ruth. She deserves special mention, because her Moabite ancestry would seem to preclude her acceptance by the people of God and would make her an unlikely candidate for such a work of grace. It would seem to make her a permanent outsider (Deut 23:3). Not only in the passage under consideration here, but throughout the book, the author delights in calling attention to the fact that Ruth is a foreigner. Some of the references, such as the dual one in Ruth 2:6, are clearly superfluous. Every opportunity is taken to remind the reader of her Moabite heritage (1:4, 22; 2:2, 6, 21; 4:5, 10). In light of this alien status, Ruth considers herself undeserving of any kindness (2:10). She has no covenant claims on the mercies of God or on those of His people. Or so she believes, perhaps, reflecting the views of her Israelite contemporaries. However, this emphasis on her foreignness serves only to highlight and to dramatize the effect when Ruth's status as an outsider is reversed, a reversal anticipated by Boaz' comment in chapter 2:12. This reversal comes to a climax in the last chapter of the book in which Ruth is portrayed as blessed by the Lord and honored in Israel (4:11-22). This foreigner, whose Moabite ancestry would seem to place her outside the orbit of such blessings, is revealed as the great-grandmother of David, the Israelite par excellence, and the one through whose line Jesus Christ would later come (Matt 1:1-17). No greater honor could be bestowed in Israel! 

Thus, we have in Ruth a striking witness to the biblical truth implied in the Genesis genealogies and later revealed anew to Peter, "God does not show favoritism but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right" (Acts 10:34-35). This truth needs to be proclaimed loudly and often in our day in which, sadly, ugly terms such as "ethnic cleansing" are alive and well. The fact that redemption and restoration are bestowed on this seeming outsider serves to highlight for us the equal status and value of all people in God's eyes. The riches of the divine kingdom are available to all who call upon the Lord's name (Romans 10:13).
