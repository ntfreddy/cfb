## CHAPTER VII
# GUIDELINES FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE 

Ekkehardt Muller 

## Introduction
A crucial and very practical issue today involves the question of which method should be employed to interpret Scripture, for interpretation is necessary, as pointed out even by Jesus (Luke 24:27). This chapter begins with general guidelines, then moves to specific exegetical steps that help us understand God's Word. From the beginning, we must keep in mind that the goal of our interpretation must be to create a "burning heart" (Luke 24:32) in both the expositor and in the audience, which draws them closer to God.

## 1. The Historical-Biblical Method 

The historical-biblical method is sometimes called the biblical-grammatical approach to Scripture, the historical-grammatical method, or the grammatical-historical method. It is to be distinguished from the predominant historical-critical method wit h its source criticism, form criticism, redaction criticism, tradition history, and socio-scientific criticism.


In contrast to most other approaches, the historical-biblical method acknowledges the self-testimony of Scripture and studies its phenomena. It accepts the claim that God revealed Himself (1 Sam 3:21), that He entered into a relationship with the human authors of Scripture (Amos 3:7; Ephesians 3:5), that He also revealed propositional truth and communicated messages (Daniel 10:1; Titus 1:3), that He inspired the human authors to share these messages with others (2 Timothy 3:16; 1 Peter 1:10-12: 2 Peter 1:19-21), and that the inscripturated message is the Word of God (Mark 7:10-13). Basic presuppositions of the historical-biblical method are:

1. The Bible alone is the final and the highest test of truth (Isa 8:20; 66:2). Alien principles of interpretation forced upon the Bible from the  outside that do not respect its self-testimony must be rejected. Principles derived from philosophy, psychology, and sociology cannot control the interpretation of the text. Tradition and science do not determine matters of faith, although they have their rightful place in human life. 

2. A second presupposition involves the totality of Scripture. The Ö¾Bible is the written Word of God, as a whole, not simply here and there (2 Timothy 3:16). The message of the prophets and of the apostles is the prepositional Word of God (2 Chronicles 36:15-16; Rom 3:2; 1 Thessalonians 2:13). The human and the divine sides of Scripture are linked inseparably (2 Peter 1:19-21).

3. The analogy or the harmony of Scripture is seen in three points: 
	(a) Scripture is its own expositor (Luke 24:27). All texts dealing with one topic must be brought together and studied in order to present correctly biblical doctrine. This is not proof-testing, in which texts are strung together without regard to their context, 
	(b) There is a fundamental agreement or unity with n Scripture (John 10:35). 
	(c) There is also clarity in Scripture. This clarity not only means that the Bible can be understood but also that clear texts shed light on difficult texts (1 Peter 1:10-12).

4. Spiritual things must be discerned spiritually (1 Corinthians 2:11,14): (a) Whoever wants to understand Scripture needs the illumination of the Holy Spirit (John 14:26). Yet, the Holy Spirit does not work contrary to the Scripture that He has inspired, (b) On the other hand, whoever interprets Scripture must have faith and a spiritual attitude (2 Chronicles 20:20). 

### The Issue of the Text

Our world today is different from the ancient Near East. Most of us speak languages other than those used by the writers of the Bible, and many elements of our cultures differ from those described in the Bible. Therefore, we must investigate the biblical texts and try to understand the languages, the time, and the circumstances under which these texts were written. We must try to see with the eyes of those who lived centuries ago and hear with their ears when they were addressed with the biblical message. While attempting to overcome barriers of time, language, and culture, we believe that we can come close to the biblical text and apply it to our situation today. 

But do we need to distinguish sharply between what the text meant and what the text means? Behind this question lies the idea and the agenda that the biblical text must be reapplied in a totally new way in order to meet our present situation. When this is done, biblical vocabulary is still used but is invested with a completely new meaning. For example, some claim that the resurrection of Jesus, which the New Testament presents as a guarantee for the future physical resurrection of the redeemed, was not a historical and physical resurrection. Instead, it merely points to a spiritual resurrection of the believers to a new dimension of life here and now, whatever that may mean. By following this approach we would replace God's original intentions with the authority of the human interpreter and would open the text to innumerable interpretations, replacing truth with relativism and pluralism.

Although we believe that God through the prophets spoke to particular situations, His message transcends these situations and reaches us today. Despite time-bound differences, a high degree of continuity characterizes the human race independent of time, culture, and circumstances, especially when it comes to moral issues.[1]

God's Word is not culturally or historically conditioned but culturally/ historically constituted. It transcends cultures and reaches us today. Therefore, what the biblical text meant in principle in its original setting is precisely what the text means for us today. Any application of a text to our situation must be tied to the original meaning. As already pointed out, Jesus himself was convinced that Scripture was directed not only to the original audience but also to the generation of His time, as well as to those to come. [2]

## 2. Interpreting a Biblical Text

When we talk about a biblical text, we may refer either to an individual verse or to a larger biblical passage containing a number of verses. These are the basic exegetical steps in chronological order:
1. Turning to God in prayer
2. Reading the text
3. Using the best possible reading
4. Translating the text
5. Investigating the context
6. Analyzing the text
7. Performing theological analysis
8. Applying the text
9. Using resources
10. Taking time

Each of these steps is essential. However, persons not trained in theology or biblical exegesis may want to skip step three, work with an existing translation (step four), and may simplify some other approaches discussed under step six. Even with these adjustments, they will benefit from the historical-biblical approach to Scripture. [3]

### Step One: Turning to God in Prayer

**Scripture.** Since spiritual things are discerned spiritually (1 Corinthians 2:14), it is natural to turn to God in prayer before starting to study the Bible. Since the Bible is the Word of God, the illumination of the Holy Spirit is essential for its proper understanding. The interaction between prayer and the study of Scripture is illustrated in Daniel 9:1-19. In this case, Bible study was followed by prayer.

**Exegetical Step.** In prayer we ask God for wisdom (Jas 1:5) and for the guidance of the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13) as we open His Word. However, prayer is not limited to the time prior to the study of Scripture. The interpreter may turn to God throughout the endeavor to understand the biblical text, presenting to the Lord what puzzles him or her and reacting to the personal challenges of Scripture. Thus, a dialog takes place between God and His Word on one side and the human agent on the other.

### Step Two: Reading the Text
**Scripture.** In Revelation 1:3, the readers of the Apocalypse are called blessed. In Luke 4:16-19, Jesus reads Scripture before He starts to interpret and apply it (Luke 4:21-27). Reading the Scripture may be private or public. In our case, we are referring to private reading of the text. 

**Exegetical Step.** In order to become familiar with the passage, the text must be read carefully and repeatedly, preferably in its larger context. Memorizing the passage can be very helpful. Memorization requires a constant repetition of the text. Frequently this repetition causes the paragraph to come alive to the reader, opening new understanding.

### Step Three: Using the Best Possible Reading

**Scripture.** In biblical times, great numbers of biblical manuscripts were not yet available, but the New Testament authors seem to have used different forms of the Septuagint (LXX ) and of the Hebrew text. However, the Bible stresses the need of its preservation without additions and deletions (Deuteronomy 4:2; 12:32; Revelation 22:18-19). Since today we have at hand thousands of New Testament manuscripts, as well as many Old Testament documents, we need to look for the best possible text.

**Exegetical Step.** Despite thousands of biblical manuscripts that have been discovered, we do not have the original manuscripts. The extant manuscripts are copies of copies originating with the autographs, containing a number of different readings. Scholars of the text are interested in the potential reconstruction of the original biblical text, with the goal of coming as close as possible to the original. The Bible remains the best preserved manuscript of antiquity and is both trustworthy and reliable. Textual analysis can be quite demanding and is the domain of specialists. It requires a good working knowledge in several ancient languages, for the task does not stop with the Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. It extends to versions in other languages, as well as to quotations in the writings of the church fathers. Therefore, most of us will work with the established Greek and Hebrew texts and/or translations into our mother tongues. 

### Step Four: Translating the Text

**Scripture.** In contrast to the Quran, which basically has to be read in Arabic, the biblical text comes in three languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Translations may be found within the Bible itself, for example, in Genesis 31:48 (Aramaic and Hebrew) and Romans 8:15 (Aramaic and Greek). 

**Exegetical Step.** The person who is able to read the biblical languages â Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greekâshould translate the passage under investigation and put it down in writing. Nuances and options exist in a text that no translation can ever capture. The translators have already made certain decisions, and even the best translation is already an interpretation. 

All those who do not have access to the respective biblical language should consultâwhere possibleâa number of good translations. There are different ways to translate the Bible. One can find paraphrases, which actually are not translations but rather descriptions of the biblical content in one's own words with plenty of room for interpretation. The Clear Word, for example, is a paraphrase.4  Real translations can be distinguished as formal or dynamic translations. 

Formal translations seek to stay as close to the original language as possible. The King James Version, the Revised Standard Version, and the New American Standard Bible belong to the category of formal translations. However, some versions may sound somewhat wooden. 

Dynamic translations try to create a relationship between reader and translation similar to that which existed between the original reader and the original text. They are less literal than formal translations. They not only Scripture analyze the text but try to restructure it. The New English Bible (NEB) and Today s English Version (TEV) belong to this type of translation, whereas the New International Version (NIV) stands between the formal and the dynamic translations. 

Good English translations include the King James Version, although the language is sometimes outdated and, on occasion, difficult to understand. Furthermore, the Greek manuscripts used for the KJV do not inelude better manuscripts discovered later. The New King James Version (NKJV), the Revised Standard Version (RSV), the New International Version (NIV), the American Standard Version (ASV), and the New American Standard Bible (NASB) are based on the most ancient manuscripts, with the latter two being the most literal English translations. 

Although sometimes we may encounter problems with Bible translations, in general, they can be trusted. Using more than one translation is a safeguard against liberties taken by some translators or groups of translators. 

### Step Five: Investigating the Context

**Scripture.** A negative example that illustrates the neglect of the scriptural context is Jesus' second temptation (Matthew 4:6) in which Satan challenges Jesus with a quotation from Psalm 91:11-12. The quotation has been shortened as compared with the original text and, therefore, somewhat misrepresented. The Psalmist talks about God's guidance "in all your ways" and not just about His intervention in special situations. The context in Psalm 91 reveals that there are snares and plagues from which God preserves the faithful. Jesus opposes any misrepresentation of the biblical text by disregarding its context. In Matthew 19:4-8 Jesus discusses divorce by citing the Old Testament context of creation (larger context) and confirms the principle of Scripture being its own interpreter. 

**Exegetical Step.** We need to distinguish between the historical-cultural context and the literary context. The literary context can be classified as the larger literary context or the immediate literary context. 

1. The Historical Context: The historical-cultural context provides answers to such question as: When was the biblical book written? Who was the human author? To whom was the book originally addressed? What was the author's purpose? A t which time and in which geographical location did events described in this book happen? What was the political, economic, and social situation at that time? What do we know about the religious background and situation? Which customs were prevailing? How did people live, work, and support themselves? What did they eat? The Bible itself, archeology, geography, and history throw light on the historical context. The historical context is very helpful and very much needed to gain a better understanding of the text that will be explored. As an example, the date in which the Book of Daniel was written, as well as the name of the author, can be derived from the book itself. Dates for events that have taken place, as well as other chronological data, can oftentimes be found at the beginning of the different chapters (Daniel 1:1; 2:1; 6:1; 7:1; 8:1; 9:1; 10:1). Consequently, the book is placed in the sixth century B.C. 

2. The Literary Context: The literary context consists of the verses, paragraphs, chapters, and even books that precede and follow the text to be studied. Normally, the literary context is available more readily than the historical context. Therefore, we distinguish between the larger and the more immediate literary context. 

a. The Larger Literary ContextâThe larger literary context is Scripture, more specifically, the biblical book from which the text is taken. This context must be consulted. The text under investigation is part of the overall message of the biblical author, and somehow it must fit into his overall message. Normally, texts are not disconnected totally from their larger context. Therefore, we look to find the place of the author's major argument. For instance, the letter to the Galatians deals specifically with justification by faith, whereas Ephesians stresses the nature of the church. The overall message or important themes of a biblical book can be identified by trying to find a statement of the author telling us his purpose of writing; by outlining the document; by watching for repetition of words, phrases, or themes; by focusing on interacting persons; and by taking note of the place in which action happens and of the time involved. 

Consider an example from Peter. In first Peter the author seems to focus on suffering. No book of the New Testament refers to suffering so often and develops this topic so clearly. But despite their suffering, the apostle calls the church members to holy conduct and to good works, a secondary theme. 

The most sweeping context is the entire Bible with its plan of salvation. Normally, each text that we study contains interesting words and specific topics. First of all, these words and topics should be traced throughout the biblical book in which they appear. If the author has written more than one book, we may also trace them through all these biblical books. Finally, it is legitimate to go one step further and explore how other biblical authors have used the very same words and concepts. There may be continuity or discontinuity, although the writers of Scripture do not contradict each other. They may have different emphases. Here we encounter the principle that Scripture is its own interpreter and that one text may illuminate another one. 

b. The Immediate Literary ContextâOne of the most important activities, If not the most important element in biblical interpretation, is the study of the literary context. Even the meaning of words normally is determined by the context. Being able to discern how a text is embedded in its context helps the Bible student avoid false or biased interpretations. 

For example, Isaiah 65:17-25 is not yet the description of the new heavens and the new earth as found in Revelation 21-22. In Isaiah 65:20 death is still present. See also Isaiah 65:23 and 66:23-24. This is a conditional prophecy for Israel, pointing to an almost ideal state that was never fulfilled on a local scale but that looks forward to the ultimate fulfillment on a universal scale as found in Revelation 21-22. Similarly, 1 Corinthians 2:9 does not describe the new earth, but the wisdom of God revealed in Jesus for our salvation. Studying the context also includes investigating its structure, determining the delimitation of passages, and identifying its literary genre. 

(1) The Structure: While reading the immediate context, i.e., the verses and paragraphs preceding and succeeding the text to be studied, these questions must be kept in mind: How does our text fit into the context? How is the text connected to what comes before and what follows? 

At times, readers of the New Testament Gospels and of the Epistles get the impression that the authors are somewhat disorganized in presenting their ideas or narratives. However, If studied diligently, usually a well-organized outline and a clear purpose emerge. The authors do not always follow our conventions. For instance, they may link passages with the use of one or more theological terms. Biblical books are not chaotic creations, lacking a degree of sequence and arrangement, but excellent literature. Therefore, it is indispensable to examine carefully the structure of the context to get a clear picture of what is going on. 

Determining the structure of a passage or a document may help us to understand the author's line of thought, notice connections between different parts of a document, and enhance our understanding of the paragraph. 

Outlining the context may be achieved by analyzing the content of the document or studying the literary features of the book, such as recurring words, phrases, and whole sentences. To establish a structure one may look for theological motifs, persons being mentioned, geographical locations, the time frame of a document, chiasms, progressions, thematic parallels, parallel reports, and repetitions. 

- Theological MotifâAn important theological motif in the Gospel of Luke is the rejection of the Messiah. It is constantly repeated. 
- Persons Being MentionedâActing personages of Revelation 4:18:1 differ widely from those mentioned in Revelation 8:2-11:18. In the vision of the seals the lamb appears ten times, in the vision of the trumpets not at all. This is also true for the living beings who are found twelve times in Revelation 4-7 and not at all in the trumpets section. However, the inhabitants of the earth are emphasized in the trumpets. 
- Geographic LocationsâGeographic locations are quite important in John's Gospel and could be used to structure it. 
- Time FrameâIn Revelation, the first part portrays several times the period between the first century A.D . and the final consummation, whereas the second part focuses on end time events only. 
- Chiasm â A chiasm is a structure in which the first section corresponds with the very last section, the second from the beginning with the second from the end, the third from the beginning with the third from the end, etc. It may have a single peak or a double peak in the middle. Chiasms are typical of Hebrew thinking. 

Daniel 2 â Four empires 
	Daniel 3 â Death decree for the faithful 
		Daniel 4 â Judgment on Babylon's king 
		Daniel 5 â Judgment on Babylon's king 
	Daniel 6 â Death decree for the faithful 
Daniel 7 â Four empires 

- ProgressionâProgression is found in the introductory scenes of Revelation, all of them relating to the sanctuary. 
- Thematic parallelsâA thematic parallel exists between the person born blind and those spiritually blind in John 9. 
- Parallel reportsâParallel reports occur in the conversion stories of Paul in Acts 9, 22, and 26. 
- RepetitionsâRepetitions are frequent, for instance, those found in Revelation 16:12-21 as compared with Revelation 17-19. 

(2) Delimitation of Passages: Another question raised when studying the context and later when analyzing the text is: Where are the boundaries of a passage? Where does a paragraph start and end? Determining the delimitation of passages becomes very important in the Book of Revelation. 

(3) The Literary Genre: Another issue is the kind of literature being used. Do we find prose or poetry? Poetry oftentimes is quite figurative and metaphorical and should not be over-interpreted. Yet, the other extreme to discount any historical value found in poetry must be avoided. 

Is the context and/or text a historical report or a prophecy? If a prophecy, is it classical prophecy or apocalyptic prophecy, such as found in Daniel and Revelation, that may include many symbols and fantastic figures?  Classical prophecy is normally conditional. It may also have more than one fulfillment, whereas apocalyptic prophecy "depicts the struggle between good and evil, and the ultimate victory and establishment of God's eternal kingdom. It is, therefore, not conditional on human responses"5 and portrays the future as it will be rather than as it may be. 

### Step Six: Analyzing the Text 

**Scripture.** In some places the Scripture's structures are clearly discernable. Some chiasms, many parallelisms, and the acrostic outline of certain psalms are recognizable for almost everyone. John, in the Apocalypse, seems to have adopted certain structural principles from Daniel, such as recapitulation. 

New Testament authors, using the Old Testament, have stressed specific words and interpreted them. For example, in Romans 4 Paul refers back to Genesis 15:6 and explains justification by faith. In Galatians 3:16, he emphasizes the singular of the noun "seed." In the Old Testament quotations listed in Romans 3, Paul underscores the words "no one" and "all " before drawing the conclusion that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Rom 3:23). Scripture encourages us to take a careful look at the text. 

**Exegetical Step.** Analyzing a text includes the investigation of the text's structure, its literary form, individual words, phrases, sentences, and larger units. 

1. Different Kinds of Structures: The structure of verses and paragraphs can be quite different. It must be kept in mind that a structure should not be forced upon a text; rather, it has to be extracted from the text. Therefore, a change of word order or of verse order to fit a structure must be rejected. However, finding the outline of a text may help us considerably to understand and interpret it. Here are a few of the possible patterns: 

	a. A n outline allows us to perceive better the issues the author is presenting, his main line of thought, the digressions he makes, and the arrangement of the material. Luke 12:15-21 can be outlined as follows: 
```
		1. Introduction: The principle 12:15 
		2. The parable 12:16-20 
			a. Scene 1: The rich man 12:16-19) 
				(1) Information on him 12:16 
				(2) Soliloquy 12:17-19 
					(a) Question 12:17 
					(b) Answer 12:18-19 
					(Topic: Goods and soul) 
			b. Scene 2: God 12:20 Monolog (Topic: Soul and goods) 
		3. Conclusion: The principle 12:21 
```
	b. In an acrostic outline the letters of the alphabet are successively used at the beginning of successive verses.6  This can be seen only in the original language. 

	c. A n inclusion is a kind of envelope structure. A statement at the beginning of a passage is repeated at its end. 
	d. A chiasm can use an ABB'A ' or an ABA ' pattern. They can be extended or joined together, and are found on sentence and on verse level, as well as on the level of large units and even of biblical books. A chiasm appears in the book of Amos (5:4-6a). 
		A "For thus says the LORD to the house of Israel: SEEK ME AND LIVE; 
			Î but do not seek Bethel, 
				C and do not enter into Gilgal D or cross over to Beersheba; 
				C for Gilgal shall surely go into exile, 
			Î' and Bethel shall come to nothing. 
		A' SEEK THE LORD AND LIVE, or He will break out against the house of Joseph like fire" (NRSV). 
	e. The most important feature in Hebrew poetry is parallelism. It also extends to the New Testament, because its authors followed Hebrew thinking. In parallelism the second line stands in a close relation to the thought of the first line, either as a repetition, expansion, or contrast. Therefore, one line can be used to explain the other line. 

	A well-known instance of parallelism exists in Proverbs 9:10. Here we relate the units by setting them in grouped style. 
	The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding (NIV). 

	f. Other features include climax, contrast, and repetition of words, phrases, and thoughts. For instance, in 1 John 1:6-10 all the verses start similarly ("If we"). Three of them begin in precisely the same way: "If we say"(l:6, 8, 10). These three verses are all negative and form a sharp contrast to the verses between them that contain divine promises (1:7, 9). This structure highlights the difference between human claims and God's offer. Furthermore, an intensification takes place with the negative verses (1:6, 8, 10) so that the climax is reached in the last verse. 

2. Literary Forms: Literary forms may change as the reader moves from context to the text itself. On the level of the forms we may, for instance, distinguish between confessions, thanksgiving, hymns, royal psalms and eschatological psalms, casuistic law and apodictic law, 7  faith formulas, proverbs, parables, miracle stories, passion narratives, admonitions, litigations, and homilies. In Scripture we find narratives which describe a certain behavior without containing a call to imitate this specific behavior. In addition we encounter reports, commandments, and admonitions that directly or indirectly call for a positive response (Rom 15:4). Behavior that Scripture clearly identifies as morally negative is not to be imitated, but positive attitudes and constructive behavior are. For instance, whereas Abraham's faith is exemplary (Rom. 4) and we are called to follow Christ's footsteps (1 Peter 2:21), Noah's drunkenness is not to be imitated (Gen 9:20-24). 

3. Investigating Larger Units: Larger units within the text under investigation are verses and short paragraphs. A number of issues need to be considered when studying these units. 

	a. Divisions of the TextâThe division into verses and chapters found in today's Bibles is not original but was added much later. Oftentimes, these divisions are helpful; on occasion, they are not. In a number of places, English translations differ from the chapter and verse count found in Hebrew and Greek editions, as well as in non-English translations. In short, divisions by chapters and verses should not determine our interpretation of a given passage. We notice this in Revelation 20:5, in which the latter part of the verse clearly belongs to vs. 6.8 

	b. Main ThoughtâWith the larger units, we must ask, How does the author develop his argument? What are his main lines of thought? Where does he take a detour or insert some other ideas? What is the main goal toward which he is moving? When a paragraph is studied, it is important to find the main topic or the author's predominant concern. 

	c. Time and Geographic LocationâOftentimes, it is helpful to investigate time elements and geographic locations mentioned in the text. We may find flashbacks in time, time prophecies, and descriptions of the future as If it were already present. Different locations may exert an impact on the message being proclaimed. A change of place occurs also when the attention is drawn from events on earth to the heavenly world. In Revelation. 12, important changes in time and in location take place. Verses 1-5 depict the early conflict between the dragon and the woman; verse 6 the medieval conflict between the dragon and the woman; verses 7-12 the conflict between Michael and the dragon in heaven; verses 13-16, again, the medieval conflict between the dragon and the woman; and in verse 17 the end time conflict between the dragon and the remnant, the descendants of the woman. 

	d. Acting PersonsâIt is useful to look at the different persons being mentioned in a text and to observe how they interact. To study these characters may be significant to the message in the passage. 

	e. Connections to Other Parts of the Document and to Other LiteratureâLiterary connections to other parts of the same document, such as phrases that have been used in our text and elsewhere become important. Where does the author quote the Old Testament? Where does he allude to the Old Testament or to the New Testament? How is his quotation used later in the canon? Where does he refer to documents outside the Scriptures? It is helpful to study parallel accounts, for instance, in the Gospels or in SamuelKings/Chronicles. 9 The Bible writers frequently cited passages from other Bible writers. We find a string of Old Testament quotations, for instance, in Romans 3. Old Testament allusions are abundant in Revelation, although the book does not contain a single direct Old Testament quotation. For example, the background of Revelation 4 is Ezekiel 1 and 10. Another example of an allusion occurs in James 5:12. James refers back to the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:37). In Acts 17:28, Paul refers to Gentile poets and in Titus 1:12 to a Cretan prophet. Under inspiration, Jude seems to quote from 1 Enoch (vss. 14-15). Literature not contained in the Bible may be used as illustration. 

	f . Allegory and TypologyâExpositors of the Bible should avoid allegorization in their interpretation. Allegorizing means to assign deeper meaning to the details of a story. There are no controls and safeguards, and the message is easily misrepresented. In the case of allegorization, the only limiting element is the imagination of the interpreter. Therefore, interpreters vary widely. The literal meaning is to be preferred. Rather than allegory, the Bible predominantly uses typology. In typology a type is met by an anti-type. For instance, a figure of the Old Testament finds its fulfillment in the New Testament, yet on a larger scale. Behind the smaller type stands a greater reality. " A type is an institution, historical event, or person, ordained by God, which effectively prefigures some truth connected wit h Christianity." [10]  It is safer to use a typological approach only when the Bible allows for it as when the New Testament refers back to an Old Testament precursor. For instance, in Romans 5:14, Adam is a type of Christ, and in John 6:14 so is Moses (citing Deuteronomy 18:15). 

4. Phrases and Sentences: After studying the larger units, we now turn to phrases and sentences. This step focuses on grammatical features and the syntax, i.e., the way sentences are constructed. It also observes literary and rhetorical patterns. 

a. Grammar and SyntaxâInvestigating phrases and sentences means to ask: What is going on here? What is peculiar? What is the message that is disclosed? We try to participate in what the text describes. Normally, the meaning of phrases is more than the sum of the words. Therefore, in addition to a simple reading, we examine the tenses and actions in verbs, peculiar expressions, and look for the syntax of phrases and sentences. Furthermore, the question has to be asked about how the different parts of a given sentence relate to one another and which message they, thereby, convey. In John 8:58, Jesus makes an astonishing statement: ".. . before Abraham was, I am." This sentence uses irregular grammar. The accepted way to speak would be: "Before Abraham was, I was." Jesus would still claim preexistence. The apparent grammatical irregularity is made on purpose. Jesus not only claims to have lived prior to Abraham, He applies the divine title of Exodus 3:14 to Himself. The people get the point. They understand that Jesus claims divinity and want to stone him (vs. 59). 

b. Rhetorical FeaturesâIn conversation today we sometimes use literary tools, such as irony, sarcasm, comparisons, and rhetorical questions that do not require an answer. Al l these and more are also found in Scripture. One has to be aware of these features to avoid misunderstanding an author. They include also hyperbole, oxymoron, paradox, and others. We find striking examples of these literary forms in the New Testament; Jesus Himself uses hyperbole: "An d you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to Hades. For If the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day." (Matthew 11:23). Paul uses irony in writing to the Corinthians, "For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!" (2 Corinthians 12:13). A n example of an oxymoron, or juxtaposition of contradictory statements, appears in Jesus' statement "To him who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away" (Matthew 13:12), and paradox: " I tell you, If these were silent, the very stones would cry out" (Luke 19:40).  

c. WordsâWhen investigating words, the most important principle is to allow the context of a given sentence to define the meaning of the respective word. Determine the ways in which the author has used it in different places. At times, we may even want to see how it is used in the rest of Scripture. A concordance is helpful and should be used as the basic tool for studying the Bible. Every word that may be important should be carefully researched. Great care must be taken not to come to a premature or hasty decision with regard to the meaning of a word. It is important to recognize how the author has used a term and what it meant for him, not what it means for us today. Contemporary ideas should not be equated with the biblical use of words. Words do change, because language is dynamic and not static. Therefore, words can have different meanings at different times. Words can also have different meanings in different contexts. Etymological studies need to be done carefully. Sometimes investigating root meanings and comparable terms in related languages is unavoidable, especially for words found in Scripture only once. However, the context has priority over against etymology. It is not permissible to use the etymology of words in an English Bible or any translation to explain the meaning of the biblical word, based on the root meaning of the translated term. In fact, the meaning of a word in the biblical languages may have a larger or smaller range of meanings than the corresponding term in a modem language. We must allow the author to speak for himself within the framework of his original language. For example: 

(1) Change of Meaning: The term "meat" in the KJV stands for food, not flesh; "corn" is grain and not maize; and "prevent" in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 (KJV) means "precede." Some words with a pejorative meaning today were positive or neutral in the past. The "Lord's day " in Revelation 1:10 cannot be equated with the "Lord's day" of subsequent centuries, in which it has become a technical term for Sunday. In Scripture similar expressions are used for the day of judgment or for the Sabbath. 

(2) Range of Meaning: The Hebrew and Greek words for "eternal" are quite broad in meaning, indicating either a limited time span or eternity. The judges in the Book of Judges cannot be compared with modern day judges. They were also leaders of the nation. 

(3) Different Meanings in Different Contexts: The term "flesh" in Galatians 5:17 denotes our sinful nature, whereas the same word in Philippians 1:22-24 refers to the physical body. It also may be helpful to study words in connection with their synonyms, antonyms, and metonyms. [11] The grammatical form of each word should also be noticed.  Words must be understood literally except when the verse or the immediate context indicates that a figurative meaning is implied. [12]  A figurative, or non-literal, meaning occurs in metaphors, personifications, idiomatic expressions, hyperboles, euphemisms, and symbols. Usually, symbols are explained by the same inspired writer who uses them or by other biblical authors. Again, it is the context that decides whether a word has to be interpreted literally or figuratively. 

d. Apocalyptic SymbolsâIn studying apocalyptic prophecy one more step must be taken. Having employed all the above mentioned exegetical steps, then and only then are we ready to identify carefully the symbols of the text with historical realities and developments. Shortcuts can lead to false identifications and false excitement that in the end only damages the church. 

### Step Seven: Performing Theological Analysis

**Scripture.** Luke reports Jesus' programmatic speech in the synagogue of Nazareth (Luke 4:14-27). The topic of liberation, in which Jesus includes the heathen, seems to be emphasized by Luke. More than the other evangelists, he shows that Jesus takes care of and frees also those who are socially marginalized by society, such as women, publicans, and even Gentiles. At least to a certain degree, Jesus develops a theology of marriage (Matthew 19:1-12) and builds it on Genesis 1 and 2. 

**Exegetical Step.** The following issues and questions are dealt with in theological analysis: Which theological motifs and themes are discussed in the biblical text being studied? How are they developed? Where do they stand within the context of the whole book? How do they relate to the overall message of Scripture? This is where the principle of comparing Scripture with Scripture is so important. A variety of theological themes-such as God, man, creation, the fall, sin, covenant, the Sabbath, the law, remnant, salvation, sanctuary, eschatology, etc.-can be found throughout the Old and New Testaments! And the theology of a particular passage must be in harmony with the theology of Scripture as a whole. In Scripture we see that the theological messages of the New Testament writers presuppose, build upon, and stand in continuity with the major Old Testament theological themes.13 Theological themes may be expressed through typology in the prediction-fulfillment sequence, as well as in the portrayal of salvation history. For example, an important part of the Sermon on the Mount focuses on the law. The term "law" is first introduced in Matthew 5:17 and found the last time in Matthew 7:12. These two verses form the introductory and concluding statements of this sermon. However, the entire passage following Matthew 7:12 seems to focus on doing God's will ; in other words, obedience to God and Jesus are central. Building on the Old Testament, Jesus discusses the Decalogue and other laws and shows their far-reaching implications. 

### Step Eight: Applying the Text 

**Scripture.** In 1 Corinthians 10:6 and 11, Paul twice stresses that Israel's history is an example for the New Testament church. Between these two statements, he warns against idolatry, fornication, presumption, and grumbling against God, using historical accounts dealing with God's Old Testament covenant people. 

In Hebrews 11 the heroes of faith are introduced. In Hebrews 12: l-2a, the writer draws a conclusion: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and sin that clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith . . ." On this basis it becomes important to apply the text to the present-day audience. 

Scripture also personalizes biblical texts. What God has done for the Exodus generation applies likewise to later generations. They still participate in His saving actions (Deuteronomy 5:2-4). Similarly, the Christian believer participates in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension already here and now (Gal 3:29; Eph 2:6). 

**Exegetical Step.** Only after a text is properly understood in its original situation can we move to its application. The application is extremely important. If omitted, the audience or readers may get the impression that we are dealing only with history. If the text is applied too quickly, however, the passage is easily misinterpreted and the exposition remains shallow. The process of applying the biblical text shows that the text is relevant for us today. Several considerations help us reach sound positions. 

1. Personalizing the Text. Already we have pointed out that humanity throughout history shares similar experiences, a similar psychological makeup, and even some common moral values. Since believers share in, and are incorporated into, salvation history, biblical texts address them on the personal level and as a group today. Therefore, when it comes to the application of biblical texts, we have to ask personal questions such as the following: What does God want to tell me with this passage? How does it affect my devotion and my commitment to Him, my spiritual life, my insights into God's character and into His plan for us, my actions, and my obedience? How can I respond to His message? By praise and thanksgiving, petition and intercession, or changing my life and reorienting my value system? Biblical texts are not only addressed to individuals but also to the church. Therefore, we have to ask: How does the respective biblical text affect us as a church? In which areas of our church life does Scripture challenge us? How does the text educate and teach us, comfort and encourage us? 

2. Applying Different Kinds of Texts: What the text meant is basically the same as what the text means today, meaning that Scripture is transcultural and trans-temporal. But we still have to wrestle with the question of permanence. Which parts in Scripture are permanent, even in details, and which contain only a permanent principle? Furthermore, what are the criteria that can help us determine this issue? (See chapter 16 on Ethics.) A closer look at the different kinds of biblical texts may be helpful. 

	a. Passages Dealing with Biblical DoctrinesâScripture contains passages and chapters that present biblical doctrines. Genesis 1-2 portrays the Creator and Creation. In Matthew 24, Jesus teaches His followers about His second coming. In Romans Paul explains righteousness through grace by faith, and in 1 Corinthians 15, he spells out the doctrine of the resurrection. Biblical doctrines stand independent of time and culture. A biblical teaching may not be understood fully by a particular generation, but the biblical doctrine of the second coming of Christ, for instance, is not true today and wrong tomorrow. To a degree biblical doctrines may be couched in cultural termsâHebrews 1 presents Jesus as king and the rest of the book presents Him as High Priestâbut even today we understand that a king is the supreme ruler and the priest a mediator. Thus, there is no difference in what the text meant and what it means when it comes to biblical doctrines. When personalizing these doctrines one has to ask: What does the Second Coming mean for me? How does the hope of a future resurrection brighten my life? How does the doctrine of creation affect me and my church? The application points to the relevance of biblical doctrines but does not change them. It shows the relationship of the doctrine to Christ, underlines its meaningfulness, and portrays the related benefits. 

	b. Prophetic Passages and PromisesâA similar picture emerges in regard to biblical prophecy, predictions, and promises. Isaiah 53 describes God's suffering servant, Psalms 2 and 110 point to the Messiah. Daniel 2 and 7 picture world history from Daniel's day to the final consummation and are not limited by time and culture. Furthermore, we must distinguish whether predictions are addressed to a certain individual or group or to all humanity. The former cannot be applied to us directly today, the latter must be. When Jesus announces Peter's denial and the possibility of his subsequent conversion (Luke 22:32, 34), He does not address us, although indirectly we are called not to follow Peter's example. On the other hand, when Jesus promises eternal life to those who believe in him (John 3:36), we are included. Universally formulated promises should be studied in the immediate context, as well as in the overall context, of Scripture, and the congregation should be encouraged to accept them and experience their fulfillment. The application of broad prophecies may point to God's sovereignty. As Lord over history, He is also Lord over our lives, carrying out His will and His plan of salvation. 

	c. Passages Containing NarrativesâScripture contains many narrative sections. How are these to be applied? The basic principle underlying a narrative needs to be uncovered and applied to the contemporary reader. Sometimes stories cannot be reduced to one single principle only and may be viewed from different perspectives that complement one another. The characters of biblical narratives may function as examples for later generations. They also may exhibit traits not to be imitated. Nevertheless, the reader can derive personal lessons from the narrative, even If it were only how not to act. In a narrative that points to a lack of trust m God, the application could elaborate what it means to trust God today and how to develop that trust. 

	d. Wisdom PassagesâWisdom literature is found in the Old Testament, for instance, in the books Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. How shall we deal with them? "Do proverbs state truth that inexorably work themselves out with no exceptions? Or do they state general principles to which there are sometimes exceptions? .. . In most cases proverbial sayings reflect what is typical or normal without suggesting or implying that there are never exceptions." [14]  For example, Proverbs 14:11 states that "the house of the wicked is destroyed, but the tent of the upright flourishes" (NRSV), which is oftentimes true. However, sometimes believers are perplexed when they see "the prosperity of the wicked" (Psalm 73:3). To be sure, there is a future dimension in which this statement will come true. Indeed, blessings of the Old Testament "are usually more spiritual in nature and reserved primarily for the future" [15]  in the New Testament. Many proverbial sayings are so plain and make so much sense independent of culture and time that their application will be more or less an elaboration of what is already said.  

	e. Passages Containing CommandsâThe real challenge comes when passages contain commands. Are all divine commands found in the Bible permanent, or not? How can we distinguish between permanent and limited commands? How do we apply commands that are no longer valid? How shall we apply permanent commands? Fortunately, Scripture tells us that some commandments or laws are not of a permanent nature. The sacrificial and ceremonial laws pointing to Jesus were fulfilled when Jesus as the Lamb of God died on the cross in the sinners' place. The type reached its fulfillment in Jesus the anti-type (Heb 10:1-18). Likewise, enforcement of the theocratic and civil laws of the Old Testament came to an end when the theocracy ended. The Old Testament itself already pointed to their limitations. Some laws were merely temporary concessions to the hardness of hearts of the Israelites but did not reflect God's ideal, for instance, the regulations on divorce in Deuteronomy 24:1-4. In His Sermon on the Mount, Jesus stressed the indissolubility of marriage (Matthew 5:31-32), and in Matthew 19:1-12 and Mark 10:1-12, He argued that God's ideal was presented in Genesis 1-3 and pointed back to it. The concession is replaced by God's original will. The New Testament clearly teaches that the Ten Commandments are still valid (Matthew 5:21-32; James 2:8-13) and that certain Christian forms, such as baptism, foot washing, and the Lord's Supper, cannot be replaced or substituted by other forms, because they are "rooted in Jesus' explicit example and command." [16] 

3. Additional Deliberations: There are three developmental questions that are helpful when moving from a text to its application. [17]  The following question is particularly important to our discussion. "What difference does it make?" [18]  This question centers on application. When it comes to the application of a biblical passage, the present audience is confronted with the good news and with the challenges of the text. 

Applying the text does not give us freedom to use the text only as a springboard for our own ideas and hobby horses. The application must correspond with the goal and with the intention of the text. But here we must become quite practical and specific. Contemporary examples and current issues are to be used to drive home the message of God's Word. The expositor must show the relevance of Scripture for the present generation. In order to be able to do that, he or she must know (1) the Word of God, (2) the church, and (3) present-day society. 

The parable of the rich fool (Luke 12:16-21) can be summarized and applied in the following way: Money does not save us, God does. Therefore, we do not live for money but for God. The passage challenges us today to get our priorities straight, not to rely on and live for material possessions but to belong to God and to be part of His mission to the world. The application develops this main goal. 

### Step Nine: Using Resources 

**Scripture.** Biblical authors not only knew the books of their predecessors, some were also familiar with non-biblical literature and used it for illustration when they proclaimed the gospel. We already have mentioned Paul, who refers to Greek poets (Acts 17:28) and a Cretan prophet (Titus 1:12). Non-canonical literature was known, and some seems indirectly recommended for reading (2 Chronicles 9:29). However, it seems that pagan and apocryphal literature served only as a means to illustrate the message of the biblical author, not to interpret it. 

**Exegetical Step.** Resource materials should be used. They can be especially helpful in providing historical, exegetical, and theological background information. Nevertheless, commentaries should only be used after having intensively analyzed the text and its context. Almost all secondary literature conveys elements of purely human construction and is to be handled with a certain reserve. 

Ellen G. White's literature is of special importance. Often it furnishes valuable insights; at other times, it is silent on particular texts or issues. In any case, Adventists would want to check what these writings have to tell us on a specific passage. Frequently, Mrs. White uses biblical texts in a manner similar to illustrations. We could call this the homiletical use of Scripture. Sometimes she interprets passages, more often, however, biblical topics. Nevertheless, even her inspired writings should not be used as a shortcut, replacing proper exegesis of a text. 

Concordances are the exception to the rule. They may already be used when the vocabulary and theological topics are investigated. Those who immediately start reading secondary literature to see how others understand a certain text or to get information on the historical background of a passage often avoid studying Scripture seriously for themselves. While the results may come quicker, understanding remains superficial, and the meaning of the text has not become part of their life. They have not wrestled with the text and have not gained a gem from it. The other danger is that they are no longer open to take a fresh look at the text but approach it with a bias or an agenda. 

Even when secondary literature is correct in its conclusions and interpretation, it may not present the full scope of what the text wants to communicate. We must study for ourselves. On the other hand, secondary literature may challenge our conclusions and sharpen our perception. If we insist that our interpretation is correct, despite the opinion of others, we must make sure that it is biblically defensible. 

Another important resource is the community of believers. If we find new ideas and interpretations that differ from the accepted understanding, it is crucial to check with others, especially with those with expertise in interpreting Scripture. Furthermore, we must be willing to abandon our interpretations or pet opinions If others show us our interpretations are questionable. Much harm has been done to the church by those who defend indefensible positions and believe they are right while all others are wrong. A wise person listens to counsel (Prov 12:15). It is rare that God reveals new understandings of the Scriptures to one individual only.
