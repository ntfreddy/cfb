## CHAPTER Χ 
# READING PSALMS AND THE WISDOM LITERATURE
Gerhard  Pfandl  and Ângel  Μ. Rodriguez

## Introduction

The  book of the  Psalm  contains  some of the  most  inspiring  subject  matter in Scripture.  It is more  often quoted in the New Testament than any  other  book  and  is  revered  by  Christians  up  to  the  present  time.   Job,  Proverbs,  and  Ecclesiastes  focus  on  the  Hebrew  concept  of wisdom  (hokmăh),     a  word  indicating both the  intellectual and moral traditions of ancient  Israel.  Because Israel's  wisdom belonged  to  the  larger  context of the  ancient  Near  East, we  find  in the biblical wisdom literature some parallels to the  sayings  of Egyptian and Mesopotamian  sages.  

The  book  of  Psalm  and  the  wisdom  literature  in  the  Bible  are  the  work of a number of authors;  the  whole collection was  probably  brought  together  in its  final  form  in the time of Ezra and of Nehemiah.  Since  these  books were written in poetic  form,  the  interpreter needs to take  note  ofthe  characteristics  of Hebrew poetry. 

## 1.  The Book  of Psalm 

The  book  of  Psalm  is  a  collection of  inspired Hebrew  prayers   and   hymns,  seventy-three  of  which  are  ascribed  to  King  David.  While  the  psalms  primarily  contain  words  spoken  to  God  or  about  God,  they  are,  at  the  same, time  God's  words  to  His people;  they  focus  on  the relationship between  God  and His children. Psalm,  therefore,  contains  hymns of praise  for God's  great  deeds; laments  in which people  pour out their hearts in times of  trouble;  and prayers  for God's  guidance  and help in the journey of  life.  They  reflect the  faith  experience  of the  people  of God prior  to  the  first  coming of Christ, but  they  are  not  time-bound. All  the  psalms  were,  and  still  are,  used  in private devotions  and in public worship. They played an important part in the temple  service down to  its destruction in A.D. Because  there  are  very  few  clues  to  their  historical setting,  they  are,  in  a  sense,  universal. They  speak  to,  and  for,  typical  human  situations  and,  therefore,  have the  capacity  to  speak to human  beings  in any  age.  Because  the  psalms  are  poems—musical  poems,  they  require  special  care  when  interpreted.  Their  poetic  character   is  not  obvious  in  translation,  because, in contrast  to western  poetry, Hebrew poetry  has  no  rhyme.  Much  of  the  language  in  the  psalms   is  intentionally emotive;  the  interpreter,  therefore,  needs to  be  careful  not  to search  for special  meanings  in  every word  or phrase in which  the author  has  intended none.  Furthermore,  because the  language  of the psalms  is largely metaphorical, the  interpreter  must  look for the intent of  the metaphors  and not  stop  at their literal  meaning.  Mountains  do  not really skip  like  rams  (Psalm  114:4); nor  should  God's  people  be  or act  like  sheep  (Psalm  23).  

## 2.  Hebrew  Poetry  

More than one-third of the Old Testament is poetry. Most of it appears in the book of  Psalm,  in the  wisdom literature  (Job,  Proverbs,  Ecclesiastes),  and  in  the  prophetic  books.  Isaiah  is  written  almost  entirely in poetic  form.  A  number of poetic  sections  are  also  found in the historical books,  e.g.,  Genesis 49  and  Numbers  23  and  24.  Only  seven Old Testament books  have  no  poetry  at  all  (Leviticus, Ruth, Ezra, Nehemiah,  Esther,  Haggai, and Malachi).  Thus,  it  is important to understand  Hebrew poetry in order  to interpret large  portions of the Old Testament correctly.

The  modern  study of Hebrew poetry  began  in  1753  with  the publication of Bishop Robert Lowth's book De  Sacra   Poesi   Hebraeorum.   He  believed that  Hebrew poetry had  a real  meter,  but that  it was  difficult  to  recognize because knowledge of how classical  Hebrew  was  spoken  had  died  out.  Therefore,  he  focused  on  the  chief  characteristic  of Hebrew  poetry,  which  he  labeled parallelismus    membrorum   (parallelism of members). 

### Parallelism 

Bishop Lowth  explained parallelism as  follows:  
The  correspondence   of  one  verse  or  line  with  another,  I  call  parallelism.  When a proposition is delivered, and  a  second  is subjoined  to it, or drawn  under  it,  equivalent,  or contrasted  with  it in sense, or similar to it in  the  form  of grammatical  construction, these  I  call  parallel  lines;  and  the  words  or  phrases,  answering  one  to  another  in corresponding  lines,  parallel  terms.[1]   

Lowth distinguished between  three basic types  of parallelism:  synonymous,  antithetic, and  synthetic,  a division  still in use  today.  

**Synonymous    Parallelism** —The    thought of the  first  line  is repeated  in  the  second  line in different words: 

Proverbs  1:20     Wisdom calls aloud  outside;  She  raises her voice in the  open  square.  

Isaiah  2:17        The  loftiness of man  shall be bowed down, And  the  haughtiness  of men  shall be brought low. 

**Antithetic   Parallelism** —The      second   line  contrasts,   or  negates,  the  thought  and  the  meaning  of the   first  line.  Frequently,  the  second  line  is  introduced with  "but."  

Proverbs  14:30   A sound  heart  is  life  to the  body,  But envy  is rottenness to the  bones.  

Proverbs  16:25   There  is  a way that  seems  right to  a  man,  But  its end  is the way of  death.  

**Synthetic   or  Formal  Parallelism** —This     parallelism is not  as  clear  as  the other two. Basically, the  second  line develops  or completes  the thought of the  first  line.  
Psalm 28:6         Blessed  be  the  Lord,  Because he  has  heard  the voice of my  supplications!  

Here the  first  line makes a statement,  and the  second  line provides the reason. 

Psalm  119:9       How can  a young man  cleanse his  way?  By  taking heed  according to Your  word.  

The  first  line  asks a question;  the  second  line provides  the  answer.  Since Lowth's work on Hebrew parallelism, additional types  of  parallelism have been identified.  For example,  in Emblematic    Parallelism,     one     line  uses  a  metaphor  or  simile,  while  the  balancing  line  makes  a  factual  statement: 

Psalm  42:1         As the  deer pants for the water  brooks,  So pants my soul  for You,  O God. 

*Climactic    or  Stairlike    Parallelism*    repeats  and  advances  the  message  in  successive  steps. The thought  appears to ascend in three  or more  steps:  

Psalm  29:1 -2     Give unto  the LORD,  O you mighty ones, Give unto  the LORD  glory  and  strength.  Give unto  the LORD  the  glory  due  to His  name;  Worship the LORD  in the  beauty of holiness. 

*Chiastic   Parallelism*[2]     inverts the words or thoughts in successive lines. Thus, what  was  first  in the  first  line  appears last in the  second  line:  

Psalm  30:8         I cried out to you, O  LORD;  And  to the LORD  I made supplication: 

### Acrostic 

Several  psalms  are  composed  in an acrostic pattern in which the  initial  letter of each verse or  set of verses follows  the  order of the  Hebrew  alphabet.  Thus, in Psalm  34 the  first  verse begins  with  the  Hebrew  letter  aleph,  the  second  with  the  letter  beth,  the  third  with  the  letter  gimmel,  etc.  In  Lamentations  3 not  one  but three  lines  are  assigned  to each  letter, i.e.,  the  first  three  verses all begin with  aleph,  the  next  three  verses all begin  with  beth,  the  next  three  with  gimmel,  etc.  In Psalm  119,  eight  verses  always  begin with  the  same Hebrew letter, and  since  the number of Hebrew  letters  is  22,  the  psalm  has   176  verses.  The  acrostic  form  may  have  been  an  aid  for memorization. Figures  of  Speech  Hebrew poetry  is rich in the  use  of imagery and  figures  of speech, but it  is  also  very  elliptic;  i.e.,  it drops  out  nouns  and  verbs  in parallel  lines  and  rarely uses conjunctions  (and, but), temporal  indicators (when, then), or  logical  connectors  (thus,  therefore).[3]   

#### 1.    Figures   of    Comparison    

*Simile* —A   figure   of speech in which  two essentially  unlike things  are  compared  by  the  use  of an  introductory "like"  or  "as."    Psalm  42:1  "As  the  deer pants  for the  water  brooks,  so  pants my  soul  for You,  O God." A simile  is the  most  easily recognizable  figure  of speech.  

*Metaphor* —In      a metaphor  the  writer  describes  one  thing  in terms of another.  The comparison  is merely implied. Psalm  18:2 "The LORD  is my rock  and my  fortress  and my  deliverer; My God, my  strength,  in whom I will  trust; My shield and  the  horn of my  salvation, my  stronghold." God was to David  as the strength of the rock and the cover of a shield providing him with  protection from  his  enemies.  

*Parable* —An      extended  simile becomes  a  parable.  It  is  a  short  story  that  teaches  a  lesson  by  comparison.  God's  parable  in  Isaiah  5:1-5   describes  God's  disappointment  with  the  vineyard  that  brought  forth  only  wild  or sour  grapes. The main point of comparison is recognized  at the  end  of the  story, "For  the vineyard of the Lord of hosts  is the  house of Israel." 

*Allegory* —An      extended  metaphor  becomes  an allegory. In the  allegory of Proverbs  5:15-23,  the main point is marital  fidelity.  "The  comparison  that  is  drawn  there  is between  the  practice  of drinking  water  from  one's  own  well  and  the  need  for  being  faithful  in  the  conjugal  responsibilities  and privileges of marriage."[4] 

#### 2.    Figures   of  Fullness   of    Expression    

*Paronomasia* —Paronomasia       is a word play in which words with  similar sound but not necessarily  similar meaning  are  repeated.  For  example,  Proverbs  11:18  says, "The wicked  man  does deceptive  (săqer)  work, But he who  sows  righteousness   will   have  a  sure reward  (seker).   The  sounds  of  the  word  "deceptive"  and  "reward"  (săqer  and  seker)  are  similar but their  meaning  is  not.   See  also  the  similarity  of the  words  for "trouble" (şărăh)  and "small" (sar) in Proverbs  24:10.  This literary effect  is usually lost in translation. 

*Hyperbole* —-This     is  a  conscious   exaggeration  or  overstatement,    e.g.,    Psalm  78:27,  "He  also  rained  meat  on  them  like  the  dust,  Feathered   fowl   like  the  sand  of the  seas." This text is part of a graphic poetic  account  of the  miracle of the  quails. To emphasize  the  showers of God's  blessings,  the number of quails is compared to the  sand of the  sea.  

#### 3.    Figures   of Association 

*Metonymy* —In     this  figure  of  speech  an  idea  is  evoked  or  named  by  means of a word  that  refers  to  some associated notion. Psalm  47:8, "God reigns  over the  nations; God  sits  on His holy throne." God's  throne  stands  for  His reign. 

*Synecdoche* —A    figure    of  speech  in which  the  whole  can  be  put  for  a  part  or  a part  for  the  whole. Psalm  26:10, "In whose  hands  is  a  sinister  scheme, and whose  right hand  is  full  of bribes." The  right hand  as  part of the body  stands for the whole  person.  

When  dealing  with  figures  of comparison,  association,  or  fullness,  the  interpreter  must  be  careful  not  to  press  them  beyond  what  the  author  had  originally intended. "Figures  of  speech are not  as precise in their meanings  as  prose is. What these  figures lack in precision, however,  is surely made up  for  in  their increased  ability to  draw pictures  for us  and  to give  a vividness  that  ordinary prose  cannot."[5]

#### Types  of Hebrew  Poetry[6]

Hebrew poetry had its origin in the  life  of  the people.  However, it was not   recreational  but  functional. It played  an  important role in the  life  of  the  nation of Israel,  particularly in  its  relationship  with  God.  Therefore,  the  prophetic  messages  were  frequently  given in poetic  form.  Not  only  were  they more  easily remembered,  but they were  also  more  emotive  and  powerful  in their message. 

**_War Songs_** —War   songs were  one of  the earliest  forms  of  poetry  (Judg  7:18, 20). The best known are the victory  songs of  Moses  (Ex 15:1-18)  and  Deborah  (Judg  5). They  usually  dwell  rapturously  on  the  power of God, who   defeated  the  enemy.  

**_Love   Songs_** —The    most  famous  love  song  in  Scripture  is  the  book  Song of Solomon.  Another poetic  expression  of human  love  is  found in Ruth  1:16-17, in which Ruth utters  some of the most  memorable  words in all  of Scripture. 

**_Laments_** —The    lament,  an anguished  cry to God, is the most common poetic  form  in the  psalms.  More than  sixty  psalms  are  either  individual  (Psalm  3)  or  corporate  laments  (Psalm  9).  Generally,  a  lament  has  several,  or  all  of the  following,  elements:  (a) The  address to God: Psalm  22:1,  "My  God,   My God."  (b)  A  description of  distress:  Psalm  57:4, "My soul  is  among  lions; I lie among  the  sons of  men who  are  set  on  fire,  whose   teeth   are   spears and  arrows."  (c) A plea  for deliverance:  Psalm  3:7,  "Arise,  O  LORD;  Save  me,  O  my  God!"  (d)  A  statement  of  trust  in  God:  Psalm  28:7,    "The  LORD   is  my  strength  and  my  shield; My  heart  trusted  in  Him."   (e) A confession  of sin:  Psalm  51:4, "Against You,  You only,  have  I  sinned, And done  this  evil in Your sight." (f) A vow to do certain things: Psalm  61:5,  "For You, O  God,  have  heard  my vows." (g) A  conclusion,  which  may  be  in the  form  of praise  or  thanks:  Psalm  30:12,  "O  LORD  my  God,  I will  give thanks  to You forever.'5  

**_Hymns_** —Hymns,     or  praise  songs,  were  used  in the  worship of God. Scholars  have  identified  three  specific  types  of hymns  in which  God  is  praised  as:  (a)  Creator  (Pss  8,  19,  104,  148),  (b) Protector  of Israel  (  66,  100,   111, 114), and  (c) Lord  of history (33,  103,  105-106,  135).7 In addition,  there  are  thanksgiving hymns  that  express  gratitude  to  God  for His answer  to  specific  prayers  (Pss  18, 30,  32,  65, 67). 

**_Imprecatory    Psalms_** —These     are  usually  lament  psalms  in which  the  writer's  desire  for vindication, based on the principle of  retribution,  the  lex  talionis,   are  especially prominent  (Pss   12,  35,  52,  58-59,  69,  70,  83,  109,  137).   Frequently,  statements in these psalms  are  shocking to modern  ears,  "Happy  the  one  who  takes  and  dashes your  little  ones  against  the  rock!"  (Psalm  137:9). However,  it needs  to  be  remembered  that  the  thought  behind  the  desire  for vengeance  is biblical  (Deut  32:35,  "Vengeance  is  Mine,");  how   it is expressed  is human.  "Some of the  language  comes from  the  covenant curses.... In other cases concepts  and phraseology  seem to be  taken  from  or  point to  some divine punitive activity  within  history against  sin-ners."8  Hyperbolic language  is common in such  emotional passages. 

#### Guidelines  for  the  Interpretation of Hebrew  Poetry  

Poetry  calls  for  a  different  hermeneutical  approach   from  that  used  in  narrative. Narrative brings  information  and  teaches by  illustration;  poetry  makes  room  for  a  freer  expression  of  inspiration. Here  are  some  basic  guidelines  to  interpret Hebrew  poetry.  

**_1.     Take Note  of  the  Pattern    of  the  Poem   or  of  the  Hymn_** —The    primary element  of  Hebrew poetry  is the pattern  of  parallel lines  as  indicated  above. 

**_2.     Group  Parallel   Lines_** —Since   the poet  is using very emotive, colorful  language,  the  interpreter must walk  a  fine  line  between  reading too much into individual lines and assuming synonymity whenever the thoughts  are similar. The context must  indicate whether  or not the clauses are  synonymous.  

**_3.    Study  the  Metaphorical    Language_** —In    Hebrew poetry,   figurative   language  is predominant  and  more  difficult  to  understand  than prose.  Job  38  and Psalm  19  are  not meant  to  teach  Hebrew  cosmology; nor  does  the  statement "I will  lift  up mine eyes unto  the  hills,  from  whence  cometh my help"  (Psalm  121:1, KJV) mean  that  God lives on the  hills. Nevertheless,  the  background to  such  imagery adds  richness  and depth to the  understanding  of  these passages. 

**_4.     Where  Possible,  Note  the  Historical   Background    to  the   Text_** —In   the  book  of  Psalm,   the  titles  of  fourteen  psalms  (3,  7,  18,  30,  34, 51, 52,  54,  56,  57,  59, 60, 63,  142) provide some historical references.   While   scholars  have  debated  the  authenticity of these titles, there  is  little  reason  to  doubt  the  basic trustworthiness of the  titles, though they  are  not necessarily  inspired. Commentaries  and  dictionaries  are  helpful  in illuminating the background  to these  psalms.  

**_5.    Study  the Poetic  Texts in  Terms  of  Their  Type and  Basic    Stance_** —    An  imprecatory psalm needs to be studied differently  from  a praise  psalm.9  Statements  about  God's  relationship  to  people  in  Proverbs  and  Ecclesi-astes  differ   from  type  to  type  (proverbs,  didactic  or  experiential  sayings,  etc.),  and the  applicability  to present circumstances  changes accordingly. 

**_6.    Study   Poetic   Passages    as   a   Whole   Before   Drawing    Conclusions_** —After    noting the  basic  structure of a poem  and  studying the  details,  the  interpreter needs to take  note of the whole passage before  explaining its meaning. 

**_7.    Study  Messianic    Psalm   in   Terms  of  Their  Historical    Significance_** —From     the  perspective  of  the  New Testament  writers, many  psalms  were  interpreted   as  Messianic  psalms;   their  words  were  quoted  with   specific   reference  to  Jesus  (Pss  2,  22,  110).  However,  in  ancient  Israel,  with  the  exception of  Psalm  110, these psalms  were not viewed as referring directly to  the Messiah; they had  a historical meaning  at the time they were written. These  psalms,  therefore,  must   first  be  studied  to  determine  the   author's   original  intended  meaning  before  they  are  applied  to  the  Messiah.   Yet,   beyond the historical meaning they "provide verbal indicators that  identify  the  typological nature of these psalms."10 In Psalm  22,  for example,  many  features  far transcend  the  actual  experiences  of  David.  They can be  understood  fully  only in the  context of Jesus' suffering. 

In  the  interpretation of the poetic  portions of Scripture, the  final  word  should  not  be  technical but devotional, presenting  to the  hearers the  wonders of God's  ways  with  man  and His grace in the plan of redemption. 

## 3.   Hebrew Wisdom  Literature  

In  addition to  the  guidelines  for  the  interpretation of Hebrew  poetry,  an  understanding  of the  special  characteristics  of Hebrew wisdom literature  will  be of benefit.   The  title  "Wisdom Literature" is  used  by  biblical  scholars  to designate the books  of  Proverbs,    Job,  and Ecclesiastes.      Catho-lie  scholarship  includes  the  apocryphal  books  Ecclesiasticus      (Ben  Sirach)  and  the   Wisdom   of  Solomon.    Some  scholars   also  include  some  psalms,  usually  called Wisdom Psalm  (Pss   1; 32;  34;  37;  49;  73;  112;  127;  128;  and  133) under  the  wisdom genre.  With  respect  to  the  Song of Solomon, there  are  different  opinions, but  many  biblical  students  would  argue  that  even  though  the  book  is,  or  seems  to  be,  a  collection of love  poems,  it  probably was  preserved  by the  Israelite sages. 

In  interpretating the  wisdom literature, it is important to  have  a basic understanding  of  the biblical  approach  to wisdom. Here we can make  only  a few general  remarks  that hopefully will  encourage the reader to study  the  books  themselves  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of the  intellectual world of  the  wisdom thinkers.  Biblical  wisdom  is  interested  in the  relationship  between  nature  and  humans  and  in the  social  life  of human  beings.  Wisdom   literature  illustrates  the  Hebrew  interest  in nature  and  in the  use  of  the human  mind  to  study it (1 Kgs 4:33). The wise persons  also  examined  human  conduct  and  learned  from  those  observations  how  to  enjoy   life.   They  discovered  the  value  of  proper  language  in  social  interaction,  the  importance  of work,  and  the  risks  and  the  dangers  involved  in improper social  relationships.  

The  motivation and  the  purpose  for  the  study  of  nature  and  human  beings  was  significantly  different from  that of modern  scientific research. The  Israelites  presupposed   that  the  Lord  was  their  Creator  and  that  the  natural world was  also  the result of  God's  creative activity. The goal of  exploring nature  was  not to uncover  the origin of its existence  but to  observe  and understand  the power  and wisdom of the  Creator.  

The Israelites believed that the wisdom of  their Creator and  Redeemer  was  mediated  to them, not just through the words of the  prophets  but  also  through creation. The wise persons, therefore,  spent time exploring God's creation in order to  apprehend  that wisdom.  But wisdom was  at the  same  time  a  gift  from  God:  "For  the  LORD  gives  wisdom; From  his  mouth  come  knowledge  and understanding"  (Proverbs 2:6). 

The  acquisition of wisdom was  preceded  by  the  "fear  [reverence] of the  LORD"  (Proverbs  1:7).    This  did  not  mean  that  fear/reverence   was  the  main  element  in the  acquisition of wisdom. It meant  that  the  fear  of  the  Lord  was  the  sphere within which it was  possible  to obtain wisdom.  Once  that  presupposition  was  accepted,  the  wise  person  went  out in search  for  wisdom.  How was  this  done? By using  basically the  same principles  we  use  today.  They  observed  the  natural  world  and  the  social  interaction of human  beings,  analyzed  what  they  observed,  and  drew  conclusions  that  impacted  the  quality of their  lives  (Proverbs  24:30-34). In  other  words,  they  used  the  rational abilities that  God had  given them  and  obeyed  His command  to  explore  the  intelligibility of the  created  world.  In the  process of analysis,  they  also  discovered  the  limitations of wisdom. What we  find  in  the wisdom books of the Old Testament  is the result of that  search for wisdom. 

### Interpreting  the  Book  of Proverbs 

What  is  a proverb?  The  term   proverb   is  difficult  to  define.  The  Hebrew term măsăl   ("saying," "song,")  has  a broad range of meanings,  making  it somewhat  imprecise  for  a valid  definition.  The  Hebrew  verbal root 171 Reading  Psalm  and  the  Wisdom  Literature  "seems to  indicate  comparison,  a  meaning  that  is illustrated, implicitly  or  explicitly,  in very  many  of the  sayings  of the  book."11  We  perhaps  could  say  that  a  proverb  compares,  contrasts,  points  to  similar or  dissimilar elements,  expressing   ideas  in  popular  sayings  that  contain  an  explicit  or  implicit  teaching.  Such  proverbs  were  very  much  a  part  of  daily  life   as   1  Samuel   10:12  and  24:13  indicate.   In  general  the  book of Proverbs  has  a  very  high view of the  role  and  of the  importance  of wisdom  in  human  existence,  without denying  some of its limitations. Widsom, a divine characteristic,  is personified  in the  book  as  a  being who  interacts  with  human  beings.   In  1:20-33;  8:1-3;  9:1-6,  13-18,  she  (wisdom)  is  set  in opposition to  a "foolish woman."  In other  places, wisdom's  activities closely parallel those ofYahweh.   Both pour  out  the  Spirit (Proverbs  1:23;  Isa  44:3);  both  called  Israel,  but  it refused  to  answer  (Proverbs  1:24;  Isa  66:4);  both  promote justice  (Proverbs  8:15;  Isa  11:4,  5); etc.   Wisdom  is the  essence of  the  being of God. Proverbs  is written in poetic  form;  therefore,  the principles used in the interpretation  of poetry  also  apply  to  the  study  of this  book.  Apart  from  that,  the  interpretation of  Proverbs could  be  facilitated by taking into consideration  the  following  suggestions:  First,  one  should  become  acquainted  with  the  structure  of the  book.  It  is  formed  by  several  collections of proverbs   from  different individuals, written  at  different  historical  periods.

```

This outline is useful  if one  is interested  in comparing  the contribution of  each collection to  a particular  subject.  It is intriguing to find two  collections of  proverbs  from  individuals who may not have been Israelites  (Agur  and  Lemuel). How did their proverbs   find   a place in the  book?  The  most  logical  suggestion  is  that  the  Lord  guided  the  prophet  in the  selection  of  that  material,  because it contained  truths  compatible  with  God's  revealed  will  for  Israel.  

Second,  most  of the  proverbs  are  single  units  of meaning  without  an  immediate  context  that could help  us  to interpret  them. In many  cases,  the  meaning  of the  proverb  is  clear,  but, in other  cases, it is  difficult  to  ascertain  its  significance.  However,  it is  useful  to  get  acquainted  with  the  cultural context  of  the writer in order  to be  able to gain  a better  understanding  of  the  images used in phrasing  the  proverbs.  

Third,  since the  purpose of the  book of Proverbs  is clearly given, the interpreter  should  pay  particular  attention  to  it  and  use  it  as  a  hermeneutical  key. In the  prolog of the  book,  Solomon  lists  a  series of goals  that  he  is  trying  to  achieve through  the  collection (1:2-6). But the  ultimate purpose  of the  search  for  wisdom  is  summarized  in  8:33-36.  Wisdom  is  so  important,  because "whoever  finds  me  finds  life  .  .  .  , all those who  hate  me  love  death."  The fundamental  issue is one  of  life  and death.  The centrality of  that  aspect is such that wisdom is described  as  "a  tree of life"  (3:18). This insight,  together  with the prolog should guide  the  interpreter in the reading  of  the  book.  

Fourth, knowing a little about  the  different literary forms used in Proverbs will  be  of help  to  the  interpreter.  As  the  title  suggests, the  most  common   form  is the proverb   or saying   pattern.  Proverbs usually  are  a  description  or  statement  about  something  with  a  particular  wisdom  twist  (e.g.,  12:5; 26:1). We have many  different types of sayings,  among  them  numerical  sayings   to  indicate  that  a list of items  is not  complete  (e.g.,  30:7,  15);  better-than   sayings,  to reveal  the  superior  value of a particular  situation or 173 Reading  Psalm  and the  Wisdom Literature conduct  over  the  other  option (e.g.,  12:9;  16:8); and  the  comparative    saying,  employed  to discourage  a particular  action  (26:8).  

Another  literary  form  are  the  admonitions.    They  can  contain  a  command  to do  something  (e.g., 3:1; 6:6)  or  a prohibition  not to do  something  (e.g., 22:24; 23:6), and, in some cases, the two are  combined  into one  (e.g.,  1:8).  We also  find  autobiographical     accounts   that contain moral lessons or teachings  (e.g.,  4:3-9;  24:30-34).  Being  aware of what  the  biblical writer is doing will  help  the  interpreter  to understand  what  is being  said.  

Fifth,  the book of  Proverbs can be  studied by using different  approaches.  One  can  study  passages in which there  is  a group  of  proverbs  addressing  the  same issue. That  facilitates  the  study of a particular  topic  (e.g.,  the  value  of wisdom  [2:1-4:27;  8:1-9:18];  poverty  [24:30-34]). But  in  most  cases, proverbs  dealing with  the  same subject  are  found in different  places  throughout  the  book.  In those  cases, it is  better to  group  the  passages  for  careful  study  in order  to  find  out what  the  book  teaches about  a  particular  topic.  This  can  be  done by  subject  areas,  such  as  prayer,  hatred,  wickedness,  righteousness,  etc.,  or  by  studying  the  characters  mentioned  in  the  book  (e.g.,  the  righteous,  the  wicked,  the  wise,  the  fool,  the  scoffer,   the   sluggard,  the  seductress).  

### Interpreting  the  Book  of  Job

The book  of  Job  is considered  by some to be  one  of  the  greatest literary works  of  humanity.  The  events it describes belong  to pre-Mosaic  days, but according  to  an  early  Jewish  tradition, they  were  written down by  Moses.  The  beauty  of  the  language,  its  literary  style,  and  its  theological  content  single  it out  as  a unique  book within  the  Bible itself.  Surprisingly,  as  far  as  we  know, none of the  protagonists  are  Israelites,  even  though  they  worship  the  Lord  (e.g.,  12:9). It is  a wisdom book in the  form of a narrative,  making  its  reading  more  interesting. It is  a discussion  of  human  suffering  as it is  being  experienced  by Job,  the main character of  the book. In the discussion  the  most  disturbing question  concerns the  role of God in the  experience of  Job.  It  is  there  that  the  issue of the  value  and  of the  role of wisdom poignantly surfaces. Does wisdom provide  an answer to the  suffering  of  the  innocent?  

With  the  exception  of the  prolog  and  the  epilog, the  rest of the  book  is  written in poetry.  In addition  to  the  principles  for  the  interpretation of poetry  discussed above,  the  following  suggestions should be  helpful in the interpretation of the  book:  

First,  the  book  primarily  consists  of  dialogs   between   Job   and   his   friends  and  between  God  and  Job.  This  dialogical nature of the  document  will  assist  the  reader  in  following  the   flow  of  ideas  and  in  determining whether  or not there is progression  in the arguments leading to  a resolution of the  theological plot. 

Second, the  dialog is formed by  the  following  three  cycles  introduced  by  a speech of Job  (chapter  3):  

**First Cycle** 
```
Eliphaz's  Speech          Job  4-5  
	Job's Response      Job  6-7  
Bildad's  Speech            Job  8  
	Job's Response      Job  9-10  
Zophar's  Speech           Job  11  
	Job's Response      Job   12-14   
```	
**Second  Cycle**  
```
Eliphaz's  Speech          Job  15  
	Job's  Response     Job   16-17   
Bildad's  Speech            Job   18   
	Job's Response      Job  19  
Zophar's  Speech           Job  20  
	Job's Response      Job  21  
```
Third  Cycle  
```
Eliphaz's  Speech          Job  22  
	Job's Response      Job  23-24  
Bildad's  Speech            Job  25  
	Job's Response      Job  26-27  
```
This  organization  is useful  to  the  interpreter  in  at  least two ways:  (a)  By  reading  all the  speeches of each of Job's  friends  in one  sitting, one  is  able to understand  their arguments better. Reading  all of  Job's responses in the  same way  will  also facilitate the  comprehension  of what  he  is  saying,  as well  as the intensity of  his psychological, theological, and spiritual pain, (b)  If the  speeches  are  read  in the  order  given in the  text  one  will  be  able  to  establish  more  clearly  the  areas of  agreements  and  of  disagreements  between  Job  and  his   friends.   

Third,  the  interpretation of Job  29:1-31:40  is important  for the  understanding  of the  book.  This monolog  seems to  precipitate  the  "resolution"  of  the plot in the book. In chapter 31, Job  appears to pronounce  an oath of 175 Reading  Psalm and the  Wisdom  Literature  innocence.  If  this  is correct, it means that  Job  is demanding that God  present the  evidence  He  has  against him or otherwise exonerate  him from  any  charges.  This is the climax of Job's defense;  from  that point on he  remains  silent, waiting  for God to  speak.  

Fourth, trying to establish  the purpose of the speech by the young man Elihu  may  be  a  difficult  task,  but  one  worth  pursuing. All  other  speeches  have  ended;  Job  is silent, waiting  for the Lord  to intervene, and  unexpectedly Elihu  speaks up. What does this mean?  Is he  speaking  for God?  Is  he  defending  Him?  

Fifth,  it is  useful  to  observe  that  the  last  part  of the  book  is  another  dialog, this time between God and Job: God's  first  speech (Job 38:1-40:2); Job's response (40:3-5); God's  second  speech (40:6-41:34); Job's response (42:1-6). This is one of the most challenging and interesting sections  of  the  book.  Does  God  answer  all the  questions  or  even  some of the  questions  raised in the  dialogs  between  Job  and  his  friends?  Why is God's  creative  and  sustaining power  emphasized  so  much?  Is that  God's  way of dealing with  Job's  claim of innocence?  What  is  the  purpose  of the  description of the  behemoth  and  the  leviathan?  Is  there  a  progression  of ideas  in Job's responses to the  divine  speeches?  

Sixth,  the  prolog  and  the  epilog  constitute  the  proper  theological  perspective  for  the  understanding  of  some  of  the  basic  issues  raised  in  the  book.  The  interpreter  should pay  close  attention to their content.  The  mystery of suffering  is  not  totally  solved,  but, by  placing it in  a  cosmic  perspective,  certain  new  insights  are  provided,  and  the  limits  of  human  wisdom  are  revealed.  

### Interpreting  the Book  of Ecclesiastes 

In  Ecclesiastes   1:1, the  author  identifies himself  as  the  son of David, king  in  Jerusalem.    The  traditional  view,  therefore,  accepted  by  Jewish  and  Christian scholars  alike,  has  been  that  Solomon wrote the  book in its entirety.   While  the  book  sounds  rather  pessimistic  in places,  it needs  to  be  remembered  that  the  basic  purpose  of the  book  is to  demonstrate  that,  apart  from  God,  life  lacks  any ultimate meaning  and  amounts  to no  more  than  vanity.  

The history of the  interpretation of Ecclesiastes  reveals  a diversity of views  concerning  its message. Many consider  the  book to  contain  a very pessimistic  view of life  that  usually leads one  to  consider  humans  as vie-tims of events  out of their control.  Others  have  concluded that the book is fundamentally  agnostic—that  it promotes  the  idea  that it is impossible to understand  what takes place  under  the  sun. Most would  argue  that  the  author of the book is not a true agnostic in that he makes  specific affirmations about God, but he  rejects  the possibility of gaining  a true understanding of human  existence.  

The  book  Ecclesiastes   is  indeed  difficult  to  interpret.  There  are  elements  of pessimism,  skepticism,  and  even  some  aspects of  agnosticism  in  the  book.  The  following  suggestions  will  be  useful  in interpreting the book. 

First,  the  primary  purpose  of  the  book  is  mentioned  in  12:9:  "Not  only  was  the teacher wise, but also  he  imparted knowledge to the  people"  (NIV).  The book  has  a pedagogical  or didactic function.  Like  all wisdom books, it attempts  to summarize  the  findings of the wise person  in order to instruct  others  and  to  make  them wise. This means  that  the  book  is  not  a  rejection  of the value of wisdom for human  existence.  It may question  the  ultimate value of human wisdom, but it does not promote  folly.  

Second,  one  should place  the book within  the  Israelite wisdom theology.  In  other  words,  it must  not  be  interpret in  isolation from  the  other  wisdom books. They provide the proper context for its interpretation. 

Third,  although scholars  have  not been  able  to agree on the  outline of the literary  structure of the book, it is clear that some sections  are  grouped  thematically. This is helpful  for the interpreter. For example, in 1:4-11, the cosmos  is  studied  and  the  conclusion is  drawn that  there  is nothing  new  under  the  sun. In chapter  2, we  find  autobiographical materials describing the wise person's  search  for meaning in joy,  work,  wisdom, and  toil.  The  conclusion of the  section  is that all is  meaningless.  

Fourth,  particular attention  needs  to  be  paid  to  subjects  that  are  addressed several  times in the book. For example,  the expression  "Vanity of vanities"  or  "Meaningless!  Meaningless!  .  .  . Everything is  meaningless"  (NIV)  appears  at  the  beginning and  at  the  end of the  book  (1:2;  12:8). In the Hebrew language,  repetition was used to express the  superlative—"absolute vanity!" Anything human  beings  may  seek in place of God is absolute vanity, according to the  Preacher.  

Fifth,  in order  to place  the book in its proper theological perspective the  reader  should  pay  particular attention to  the  epilog (12:9-14).   The   voice  that  we  hear  there  is  the  voice  of  the  narrator  summarizing  the  fundamental  message of the  book  for  the  reader. That  is precisely  what  makes  the epilog so important for the interpreter. It makes  clear  that pessimism  is  not  the  ultimate message of the  book.  Certainly "everything is  meaningless,"  but  there  is  more  to  life  than  simply  trying  to   find  its  present  significance. The  interpreter  should carefully explore the  contribution of the epilog to the message and to the theology of the  book: What is that  contribution? In what  sense does it set  limits  to  the  content of the 177 Reading  Psalm  and  the  Wisdom  Literature  rest of the  book?  What  is  its  significance  for  a  Christian reading  of  the  book? 

### Interpreting  the  Song  of  Solomon  

The  history of  the  interpretation of  this  book,  which  in  the  opening  verse  is  attributed  to king  Solomon, reveals  a  great  deal  of confusion  that  should  alert  the  reader to  the  complexity of the  interpretational  task.  The  most  common  approach   has  been  to  treat  it  as  an  allegory  (see  chapter  13).  Primarily, because the  book  appears  to  be  quite  secular,  even  erotic.  The  allegorical approach  looks  for  meanings  in  a  text  beyond  the  literal  sense of the  language.  In the  case of the  book  Song  of Solomon, it is understood  to  be non historical but containing deep spiritual truths. Using the allegorical  method,  Jewish  interpreters  concluded  that  the  male  figure  in  the  poems  was  the  Lord  and  the  Shulamite  girl  was  Israel.  Others  saw  in  the  experience  of the  man  and  the  woman  the  way  that  wisdom  and  the  student  of wisdom  should relate  to each other. Among Christians, the  book  has  been  read  as  a  description of the  relationship  between  Christ  and  the  church. That is, its spiritual value  has  been decoded  through the allegorical approach.  This raises the  question  whether  the text itself is suggesting  this  approach  and  whether,  in  spite  of the  apparent  secular  dimension  of  the  text,  there  is  a theological concern,  or message, in the  book.  

There  is no indication in Scripture that the book  is an allegory. Neither Jesus nor  any of the New Testament writers  ever  referred  to it; but  this  does not  mean  that this love song  does not have some spiritual value. Scripture  repeatedly  illustrates  the  union between  God  and  His people  by  the  relationship of a husband  to his bride (Isa 54:4,  5; Jer  3:14;  2 Cor  11:2), and Ellen G. White, on  occasion,  used passages  from  the book to illustrate spiritual truths12;  but  this  does not  mean  that  she  considered  the  book  to  be  an  allegory  or  that  she  used the  allegorical method  to interpret it. 

How   should  the  book  be  interpreted?  First,  the  book  should  be  read  many times.  One  of  the most  obvious things that the  interpreter will  realize  is the  fact that we  are  dealing here with  love poetry.  Second,  the poems  are  primarily  spoken by two individuals, namely  a woman (e.g., Song  1:2)  and  a man  (e.g., 4:1-2). There  are  references  to the daughters of  Jerusalem, but they  do  not  seem to play any  active role in the  book  (e.g.,  1:5).  Third,  the  book  is  characterized  by  dialogs  (e.g.,  1:7-8;  15-16;  8:13-14)  and  mono-logs  (e.g., 3:1-5;  6:4-10). Their study  is useful  in understanding  the  nature  of the  poems.  

Fourth, particular attention needs to be paid to the  language that  is used so  that  the  poems  can  be  interpreted  within  the  cultural context  in  which  178 Reading  Psalm  and  the  Wisdom  Literature  they  were  written.  This  means  the  interpreter  should  have  access to  commentaries  or biblical dictionaries that will provide that information. Using a concordance  is probably the best way to understand  the particular terminology  used in the book.  Sometimes  it is difficult  to understand  the point being made through  a comparison.  For  instance,  the man  says, "Your two breasts are  like  two  fawns,  twins of a  gazelle  which  feed  among  the  lilies"  (Song  4:5, NASB).  A possible  interpretation of this comparison  sees the  gazelles  as "symbols of life  and renewal."13  The  fawns  add to the  image  elements of softness  and  playfulness.  O. Keel  says, "Hebrew  literature  does not  attach  notions of form  to the term 'breasts' but notions  of  blessing  (Gen 49:25), of kindness,  nourishment,  and  trust building  (Psalm  22:9;  Job  3:12), of  softness,  warm  security ...  in short,  notions of   foil  participation in life  and of life's renewal."[14]  This means that "both breasts and fawns  of  a gazelle  symbolize  the warmth of life,  an  inspiring and victorious counterforce  to  death."[15]    

Fifth,  notice  should  be  taken  of the  freedom  with  which  the  biblical  writer  speaks  about  sexual  matters.  This reveals to  the  interpreter  the  way  in  which  the  Bible  looks  at  sex  and  sexual  relations.  Sixth,  the  fundamental  intention or  message of the  poems  needs  to  be  investigated.  This  can  be  done by paying particular  attention  to  what  is  emphasized  in the  book  through repetitions.  Such repeated ideas  as  love, marriage,  longing for  the  other,  and  the  references  to  the  garden  will  be  helpful  in the formulation and in the  development  of the theology of the  book.  

## Conclusion 

In  the  interpretation of  Psalm and of the  wisdom literature in Scripture, we  need to  use  the  same principles we  use  in other  parts of  Scripture  —linguistic  and  contextual  analysis  and  background  studies   concerning   the  text  or  passage. In addition, it will  be  of help if the  interpreter  has  a  good grasp of  the  special  characteristics  of Hebrew poetry  and of the  concept of wisdom in the  Old Testament.  

When  reading  the  wisdom  literature  we  need  to  remember   that  it  teaches  rational  living,  which,  at  the  same  time,  is  good  and  godly  living.  And it teaches how  when  troubles  come  the  wise  can  bear it. Hence, common  sense and  sound judgment will  help the  interpreter  to  understand  what God  is saying through these poetic  portions of Scripture.
